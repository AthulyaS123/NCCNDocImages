Not all invasive breast cancers are the same. Treatment planning starts with testing. Your care team will want to gather information about the cancer you have. This chapter presents an overview of the tests you might receive and what to expect.

Tests are used to find cancer, plan treatment, and check how your cancer is responding to treatment. Results from a tumor biopsy and imaging studies will be used to determine what treatments are best for your type of breast cancer. Testing takes time. For possible tests, **see Guide 1.**

# General health tests

## Medical history

A medical history is a record of all health issues and treatments you have had in your life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury and when it happened. Bring a list of old and new medicines and any over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, herbals, or supplements you take. Some supplements interact with and affect medicines that your care team may prescribe. Tell your care team about any symptoms you have. A medical history, sometimes called a health history, will help determine which treatment is best for you.

## Family history

Some cancers and other diseases can run in families. Your doctor will ask about the health history of family members who are blood relatives. This information is called a family history. Ask family members on both sides of your family about their health issues like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. It's important to know the specific type of cancer, or where the cancer started, if it was in multiple locations, how old they were when they had the cancer, and if they had genetic testing.

**Guide 1**
**Possible tests**

  * Medical history and physical exam
  * Diagnostic mammogram. Other imaging tests as needed
  * Biopsy with pathology review
  * Tumor estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status
  * Tumor HER2 status
  * Genetic counseling and testing if at risk for hereditary breast cancer or have triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)
  * Address fertility and sexual health concerns
  * Pregnancy test in those of childbearing potential
  * Assess for distress
  * Lymphedema baseline screening

## Physical exam

During a physical exam, your health care provider may:

  * Check your temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and breathing rate
  * Check your height and weight
  * Listen to your lungs and heart
  * Look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat
  * Feel and apply pressure to parts of your body to see if organs are of normal size, are soft or hard, or cause pain when touched.
  * Examine your breasts to look for lumps, nipple discharge or bleeding, or skin changes.
  * Feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your neck, underarm, and groin.

## Clinical breast exam

A clinical breast exam (CBE) is a physical exam of the bare breast performed by a health care provider to check for lumps or other changes. It is done while you are seated and/or lying down. Your provider should take time to palpate (feel) the entire breast, including the armpit. A nurse or assistant might also be in the room during the exam.

## Distress screening

Distress is an unpleasant experience of a mental, physical, social, or spiritual nature. It can affect how you feel, think, and act. Distress might include feelings of sadness, fear, helplessness, worry, anger, and guilt. You may also experience depression, anxiety, and sleep issues.

It is normal to have strong feelings about being diagnosed with cancer and your feelings can also change from day to day and week to week. Talk to your care team and those whom you feel most comfortable about how you are feeling. There are services, people, and medicine that can help you. Support and counseling are available. Your treatment team will ask about your level of distress. This is part of your cancer care.

More information on distress can be found in the *NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Distress During Cancer Care* at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

## Lymphedema baseline screening

Lymphedema is a condition in which lymph fluid builds up in tissues and causes swelling. A lymphedema baseline screening measures the fluid levels in your body. It is done to look for small changes in the body after surgery.

## Performance status

Performance status (PS) is a person's general level of fitness and ability to perform daily tasks. Your state of general health might be rated using a PS scale called the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score or the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS). PS is one factor taken into consideration when choosing a treatment plan.

# Fertility (all genders)

Some types of treatment such as chemotherapy can affect fertility, or the ability to have children. If you think you want children in the future, ask your care team how cancer and cancer treatment might change your fertility. To preserve your fertility, you may need to take action before starting cancer treatment. Those who want to have children in the future should be referred to a fertility specialist to discuss the options before starting treatment.

Fertility preservation is all about keeping your options open, whether you know you want to have children later in life or aren't sure at the moment. Fertility and reproductive specialists can help you sort through what may be best for your situation.

More information on fertility preservation can be found at *NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer* at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

## Changes in fertility

Treatment might cause your fertility to be temporarily or permanently impaired or interrupted. This loss of fertility is related to your age at time of diagnosis, treatment type(s), treatment dose, and treatment length. Talk to your care team about your concerns and if you are planning a pregnancy.

## Preventing pregnancy during treatment

Preventing pregnancy during treatment is important. Cancer treatment can affect the ovaries, damage sperm, and hurt a developing baby. Therefore, becoming pregnant or having one's partner become pregnant during treatment should be avoided. Non-hormonal birth control methods such as intrauterine devices (IUDs) and barrier methods are preferred in those with a breast cancer diagnosis. Types of barrier methods include condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps, and the contraceptive sponge. If you are pregnant at the time of your cancer diagnosis, treatment will need to be tailored to protect your unborn child. If you are breastfeeding at the time of cancer diagnosis, you may need to stop breastfeeding during treatment.

## Blood tests

Blood tests check for signs of disease and how well organs are working. Some blood tests you might have are described next.

### Alkaline phosphatase

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme found in the blood. High levels of ALP can be a sign cancer has spread to the bone or liver. A bone scan might be performed if you have high levels of ALP.

### Complete blood count

A complete blood count (CBC) measures the levels of red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLTs) in your blood. Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout your body, white blood cells fight infection, and platelets control bleeding.

### Comprehensive metabolic panel

A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) measures substances in your blood. It provides important information about how well your kidneys and liver are working, among other things

### Liver function tests

Liver function tests (LFTs) look at the health of your liver by measuring chemicals that are made or processed by the liver. Levels that are too high or low signal that the liver is not working well or that cancer has spread to the liver.

### Pregnancy test

Those who can become pregnant will be given a pregnancy test before treatment begins.

# Imaging tests

Imaging tests take pictures of the inside of your body. Imaging tests show the primary tumor, or where the cancer started, and look for cancer in other parts of the body.

A radiologist, a medical expert, will interpret the test and send a report to your doctor. While these reports might be available to you through your patient portal or patient access system, please wait to discuss these results with your care team

The following imaging tests are not in order of importance. You may not need all of these tests.

## Bone scan

A bone scan uses a radiotracer to highlight areas of bone damage or loss. A radiotracer is a substance that releases small amounts of radiation. Before the pictures are taken, the tracer will be injected into your vein. It can take a few hours for the tracer to enter your bones. However, the test is quick and painless.

A special camera will take pictures of the tracer in your bones as it moves over your body. Areas of bone damage take up more radiotracer than healthy bone and show up as bright spots on the pictures. Bone damage can be caused by cancer, cancer treatment, previous injuries, or other health issues.

## Bone x-ray

An x-ray uses low-dose radiation to take one picture at a time. A tumor changes the way radiation is absorbed and will show up on the x-ray. X-rays are also good at showing bone issues. Your care team may order x-rays if your bones hurt or were abnormal on a bone scan.

## Contrast material

Contrast material is a substance used to improve the quality of the pictures of the inside of the body. It is used to make the pictures clearer. Contrast might be taken by mouth (oral) or given through a vein (IV). Oral contrast does not get absorbed from your intestines and will be passed with your next bowel movements. IV contrast will leave the body in the urine immediately after the test.

The types of contrast vary and are different for CT and MRI. Not all imaging tests require contrast, but many do.

Tell your care team if you have had allergic reactions to contrast in the past. This is important. You might be given medicines to avoid the effects of those allergies. Contrast might not be used if you have a serious allergy or if your kidneys aren't working well.

## CT scan

A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan uses x-rays and computer technology to take pictures of the inside of the body. It takes many x-rays of the same body part from different angles. All the images are combined to make one detailed picture. Intravenous (IV) contrast is often used.

## Diagnostic mammogram

A mammogram is a picture of the inside of your breast. The pictures are made using x-rays. A computer combines the x-rays to make detailed pictures. A bilateral mammogram includes pictures of both breasts. Mammogram results are used to plan treatment.

Diagnostic mammograms look at specific areas of your breasts, which may not be clearly seen on screening mammograms. They are used to see tumor and the size of the tumor(s). Diagnostic mammograms include extra compression in certain areas of the breast, magnification views, or rolling the breast to image additional areas of the breast. Other tests may include a breast MRI or ultrasound.

### What's the difference between a screening and diagnostic mammogram?

A mammogram is a picture of the inside of your breast made using x-rays. During a mammogram, the breast is pressed between two plates while you stand in different positions. Multiple x-rays will be taken. A computer combines the x-rays to make detailed pictures.

  * **Screening mammogram**
      * Done on a regular basis when there are no signs or symptoms of breast cancer. Results take a few days.
  * **Diagnostic mammogram**
      * Used for those who have symptoms such as a lump, pain, nipple thickening or discharge, or those whose breasts have changed shape or size. An ultrasound is often used with a diagnostic mammogram.
      * Also used to take a closer look at an abnormal area found in a screening mammogram.
      * A radiologist will evaluate the diagnostic mammogram while you wait so if additional testing is needed, it can be done right away.

Both types of mammograms use low-dose x-rays to examine the breast. They may use either the standard 2-dimensional (2D) digital mammogram or 3-dimensional (3D) mammogram known as tomosynthesis.

## MRI scan

A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan uses radio waves and powerful magnets to take pictures of the inside of the body. It does not use x-rays, which means there is no radiation delivered to your body during the test. Because of the very strong magnets used in the MRI machine, tell the technologist if you have any metal or a pacemaker in your body. During the test, you will likely be asked to hold your breath for 10 to 20 seconds as the technician collects the images. Contrast is used.

A closed MRI has a capsule-like design where the magnet surrounds you. The space is small and enclosed. An open MRI has a magnetic top and bottom, which allows for an opening on each end. Closed MRIs are more common than open MRIs, so if you have claustrophobia (a dread or fear of enclosed spaces), be sure to talk to your care team about it. MRI scans take longer to perform than CT scans.

  * **A breast MRI** might be used in addition to a mammogram. You will be positioned face down in the machine with your arms above your head.
  * **A spine or brain MRI** can be used to detect breast cancer that has spread (metastasized) to the spine or brain.

### Breast MRI

If needed, a breast MRI will be done in addition to a mammogram. In a breast MRI, you are positioned face down with your arms overhead.

## PET scan

A PET (positron emission tomography) scan uses a radioactive drug called a tracer. A tracer is a substance injected into a vein to see where cancer cells are in the body and how much sugar is being taken up by the cancer cells. This gives an idea about how fast the cancer cells are growing.

Cancer cells show up as bright spots on PET scans. However, not all tumors will appear on a PET scan. Also, not all bright spots found on the PET scan are cancer.

It is normal for the brain, heart, kidneys, and bladder to be bright on PET. Inflammation or infection can also show up as a bright spot. When a PET scan is combined with CT, it is called a PET/CT scan.

> An **FDG-PET/CT** uses a radiotracer called fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). It is made of fluoride and a simple form of sugar called glucose. You cannot eat or drink for at least 4 hours before the scan. This scan is most helpful when other imaging results are unclear.
> A **sodium fluoride PET/CT** uses a radiotracer made of sodium fluoride.
> An **FES-PET/CT** uses **FES**, which is a radioactive form of the hormone estrogen. An FES-PET/CT might be used when cancer is estrogen receptor-positive (ER+).

Testing takes time. It might take days or weeks before all test results come in.

## Ultrasound

An ultrasound (US) uses high-energy sound waves to form pictures of the inside of the body. This is similar to the sonogram used for pregnancy. A wand-like probe (transducer) will be held and moved on your bare breast using gel. It may also be placed below your armpit. Ultrasound is painless and does not use x-rays, so it can be repeated as needed. Ultrasound is good at showing small areas of cancer in the breast and abnormal lymph nodes. Sometimes, a breast ultrasound or MRI is used to guide a biopsy.

# Biopsy

A biopsy is the removal of a sample of tissue from your body for testing. A pathologist will examine the biopsy for cancer and write a report called a pathology report. Ask questions about your biopsy results and what it means for your treatment.

There are different types of biopsies. Some biopsies are guided using imaging, such as ultrasound or MRI. The primary or main tumor is biopsied first. Other tumors or tumors in different areas may also be biopsied. You may have tissue removed from the breast, lymph nodes, or both.

Types of possible biopsies include:

  * **Fine-needle aspiration (FNA)** or **core biopsy (CB)** uses needles of different sizes to remove a sample of tissue or fluid. In a **vacuum-assisted core biopsy (VACB)**, suction from a special vacuum device is used to remove the sample through a needle.
  * **Incisional biopsy** removes a small amount of tissue through a cut in the skin or body.
  * **Excisional biopsy** removes the entire abnormal area. This is not the preferred type of biopsy, but may be necessary if other methods are not possible or when the biopsy results don't match the expected findings. An excisional biopsy is usually done under anesthesia by a surgeon in an operating room.

Before biopsies are performed, usually the area is injected with numbing medicine. A core needle biopsy (CNB) removes more than one tissue sample, but usually through the same area on the breast. The samples are small. The needle is often guided into the tumor with imaging. When mammography is used during a biopsy, it is called a stereotactic needle biopsy.

One or more clips may be placed near the breast tumor during a biopsy. The clips are small, painless, and made of metal. They will mark the site for possible future treatment and imaging. The clips will stay in place until surgery. If the area biopsied is benign, the clip will remain in place to mark the biopsy site on future imaging. The clips cause no problems, even if they are left in place for a long time. You will be able to go through airport security and have an MRI.

## Axillary lymph node needle biopsy

An axillary lymph node (ALN) drains lymph fluid from the breast and nearby areas. In an axillary lymph node biopsy, a sample of lymph node near the armpit (axilla) is biopsied with a needle. This is to determine if abnormal lymph nodes seen on imaging tests contain cancer cells. An ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (US-FNA) or core biopsy will be used. If cancer is found, it is called node positive (node+). A marker may be placed in the node so that it can be identified later if needed.

## Biopsy results

Histology is the study of the anatomy (structure) of cells, tissues, and organs under a microscope. The tissue may be benign (not cancer), atypical (not typical), or cancerous. If the tissue is benign, likely this area can be observed. If the tissue is atypical, you may be recommended to have a surgical (open) biopsy of the area for further evaluation. If tissue shows cancer, your health care provider will discuss next steps. Your pathology report will contain information about histology and the grade (how abnormal the tumor looks) of the cancer.

# HER2 status

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a protein involved in normal cell growth. It is found on the surface of all cells. When amounts are high, it causes cells to grow and divide. Some breast cancers have too many HER2 genes or receptors. Too many HER2s is called HER2-positive (HER2+). You might hear it called HER2 overexpression or amplification.

There are 2 tests for HER2:

  * **Immunohistochemistry (IHC)** measures receptors. If the IHC score is 3+, the cancer is HER2+. If the score is 0 or 1, it is considered HER2-negative (HER2-). If the score is 2+, further testing is needed.
  * **In situ hybridization (ISH)** counts the number of copies of the HER2 gene. This test is done mainly when the IHC score is unclear.

HER2 testing should be done on all new invasive tumors. A tumor biopsy sample will be used. You might have more than one HER2 test.

## Treatment options by cell receptor type

There are many treatments for breast cancer. Which ones are right for you are based on many factors. **Two important factors are the hormone receptor (HR) and HER2 status of any tumors.**

  * Hormone receptors include estrogen and progesterone. A tumor is considered hormone receptor-positive (HR+) if an increased number of estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, or both are found.
  * HER2 is a protein involved in normal cell growth. There might be higher amounts of HER2 in your breast cancer. If this is the case, it is called HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer.

**Endocrine therapy** stops cancer growth caused by hormones. It is a standard treatment for hormone receptor-positive (HR+) cancers. HR+ cancer can be estrogen receptor-positive (ER+), progesterone receptor-positive (PR+), or both (ER+/PR+).

**HER2-targeted therapy** is a standard treatment for HER2+ cancers.

Other systemic therapies are used with those listed above to treat invasive breast cancer.

## Immunohistochemistry

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a special staining process that involves adding a chemical marker to cancer or immune cells. The cells are then studied using a microscope. IHC can find estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors in breast cancer cells. A pathologist will measure how many cells have estrogen and/or progesterone receptors and the number of receptors inside each cell.

## FISH or ISH

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or other ISH methods like dual ISH are testing methods that involve special dyes called probes that attach to pieces of DNA, the genetic material in a person's cells.

## Hormone receptor status

Your blood carries hormones throughout your body. A hormone is a substance made by a gland in your body. A receptor is a protein found inside or on the surface of a cell. When substances such as hormones attach (bind) to these receptors, it causes changes within the cell. When hormones attach to receptors inside breast cancer cells, they can cause cancer to grow. If found, these receptors may be targeted using endocrine (hormone-blocking) therapy.

There are 2 types of hormone receptors:

  * **Estrogen** plays a role in ovary, uterus, and breast development
  * **Progesterone** plays a role in menstrual cycle and pregnancy

### Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer cells

  * In ER+ breast cancer, testing finds estrogen hormone receptors in at least 1 out of every 100 cancer cells.
  * In ER-low-positive invasive breast cancer, testing finds estrogen hormone receptors in 1 to 10 out of every 100 cancer cells.

Hormone receptor (HR) testing should be done on any new tumors. A biopsy sample will be used.

## Hormone receptor-positive

In hormone receptor-positive (HR+) or hormone-sensitive breast cancer, IHC finds estrogen receptors (ER+), progesterone receptors (PR+), or both (ER+/PR+). Most breast cancers are ER+/PR+ or ER+/PR-.

> **Estrogen receptor (ER)** is stimulated by estrogen and provides survival and proliferation (rapid growth) signals. Cancer cells deprived of estrogen or that have their ER signal blocked with treatment may stop growing or die.
> **Progesterone receptor (PR)** binds progesterone and provides survival and proliferation signals. It is thought that PR expression also suggests the tumor is estrogen dependent. An ER-/PR+ tumor is relatively uncommon.

HR+ breast cancer is treated with endocrine therapy, which blocks estrogen receptor signaling or decreases estrogen production.

## Hormone receptor-negative

Hormone receptor-negative (HR-) breast cancer cells do not have estrogen or progesterone hormone receptors. These cancers are sometimes simply called hormone negative. HR- cancers often grow faster than HR+ cancers. Both the estrogen and progesterone receptors need to be negative for breast cancer to be considered HR-.

## Biomarker testing

Biomarker testing or tumor mutation testing is more commonly done in metastatic breast cancer. For more information, see *NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Metastatic Breast Cancer* at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

## Genetic cancer risk testing

About 1 out of 20 breast cancers are hereditary. Depending on your family history or other features of your cancer, your health care provider might refer you for hereditary genetic testing to learn more about your cancer. A genetic counselor or trained provider will speak with you about the results. Tests results may be used to guide treatment planning.

Genetic testing is done using blood or saliva (spitting into a cup or using a cheek swab). The goal is to look for gene mutations inherited from your biological (birth) parents called germline mutations. Some mutations can put you at risk for more than one type of cancer. You can pass these genes on to your children. Also, other family members might carry these mutations. Tell your care team if there is a family history of cancer.

More information on genetic cancer risk testing can be found in the *NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast, Ovarian, Pancreatic, and Prostate Cancers* at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

### BRCA tests

Everyone has *BRCA* genes. Normal *BRCA* genes help to prevent tumor growth. They help fix damaged cells and help cells grow normally. *BRCA* mutations put you at risk for more than one type of cancer. Mutations in *BRCA1* or *BRCA2* increase the risk of breast, ovarian, prostate, colorectal, pancreatic, and melanoma skin cancers. Mutated *BRCA* genes can also affect how some treatments work. These tests might be repeated if you tested negative for a gene mutation over 10 years ago, as genetic testing technology has improved.

### Other genes

Other genes such as *PALB2*, *p53*, *CHEK2*, and *ATM* might be tested. For example, *PALB2* normally helps prevent cancer. When *PALB2* mutates, it no longer works correctly. Those with a *PALB2* mutation have a higher risk of developing breast cancer.

## What is your family health history?

Some cancers and other diseases run in families—those who are related to you through genes passed down from biological (birth) parent to child. This information is called a family health history. Ask blood relatives about their health issues like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, and at what age they were diagnosed. For relatives who were diagnosed with cancer, ask them (or other relatives if they are no longer living) what type of cancer they had, if they died from the cancer, and at what age the cancer was diagnosed.

Start by asking your parents, siblings, and children. Next, talk to half-siblings, aunts and uncles, nieces and nephews, grandparents, and grandchildren.

Write down what you learn about your family history and share with your health care provider.

Some of the questions to ask include:

  * How old were you when each of these diseases and health conditions was diagnosed?
  * What is our family's ancestry—from what countries did our ancestors originate?

# Key points

  * Tests are used to find cancer, plan treatment, and check how your cancer is responding to treatment.
  * You will have a physical exam, including a breast exam, to see if anything feels or looks abnormal.
  * Treatment can affect your fertility or the ability to have children. You might be referred to a fertility specialist to discuss fertility preservation.
  * A diagnostic mammogram includes detailed pictures of both breasts. It is different than a screening mammogram.
  * During a biopsy, tissue or fluid samples are removed for testing. Samples are needed to confirm the presence of cancer and to perform cancer cell tests.
  * A sample from a biopsy of your tumor will be tested for estrogen receptor (ER) status, progesterone receptor (PR) status, HER2 status, and histology. This provides information about the behavior of your cancer, as well as treatments to which your cancer may respond. Other biomarker tests may be performed.
  * About 1 out of 20 breast cancers are hereditary. Depending on your family history or other features of your cancer, your health care provider might refer you for hereditary genetic testing or to speak with a genetic counselor.
