When cancer returns, it is called a recurrence. Treatment is based on the types of treatment you had before. Together, you and your care team will choose a treatment plan that is best for you.

# Overview

Breast cancer can return in the following areas:

  * It can return to the breast or chest wall of the breast that had cancer before. This is called **local recurrence**.
  * It can return to axillary lymph nodes or lymph nodes in or near the breast. This is called **regional recurrence**.
  * It can return to other distant parts of the body. This is called **metastatic breast cancer**.
  * You can also have a **new breast cancer** that is not a recurrence of an earlier cancer.

This chapter presents treatment options for local and regional recurrence.

# Tests

You will have tests to learn more about your cancer. Many tests you had when you were first diagnosed will be repeated. This is called restaging. Tests for recurrence can be found in **Guide 8**.

**Guide 8**
**Possible tests: Recurrence**

  * Medical history and physical exam
  * Blood tests such as CBC and comprehensive metabolic panel (including liver function tests and alkaline phosphatase)
  * Chest CT with or without contrast
  * CT with contrast of abdomen with or without pelvis (MRI with contrast might be done instead)
  * Other imaging as needed
  * Biopsy tumor or metastasis and test for biomarkers, including estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 status
  * Genetic counseling if at risk for hereditary breast cancer
  * Assess for distress

# Treatment

Treatment is based on where the cancer has returned and what type of treatment you had before. Surgery followed by radiation therapy (RT) and systemic (drug) therapy are possible. Systemic and endocrine therapy options will be based on tumor hormone receptor (HR) status, HER2 status, and treatments given during your initial cancer treatment. Supportive care is always given. Supportive care aims to relieve side effects such as pain and to improve quality of life.

## Local recurrence

Treatment for cancer that has returned to the same breast as before is based on if your first treatment was breast-conserving surgery (lumpectomy) or a mastectomy. More surgery might be an option. If you had radiation therapy before, then it may or may not be possible to have radiation again in the same area, which may limit your surgical options.

## Regional recurrence

If the recurrence is in or near the armpit (axilla), then surgery to remove the tumor might be an option before radiation therapy. Systemic therapy might be given before surgery to help reduce the amount of cancer or the size of the tumor. Treatment after surgery might include radiation therapy to the lymph nodes. If you had radiation therapy before, then it may not be possible to have it again to the same area.

## Both local and regional

Cancer that is both local and regional might be referred to as a locoregional recurrence. Treatment for a locoregional recurrence is surgery and radiation therapy followed by systemic therapy.

## Unresectable

An unresectable tumor cannot be removed with surgery. It is treated with systemic therapy. For treatment of unresectable recurrent disease, see NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Metastatic Breast Cancer, available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

# Key points

  * When cancer returns, it is called a recurrence.
  * Cancer that returns to the breast that had cancer before is called a local recurrence.
  * Cancer that returns to axillary lymph nodes or lymph nodes in or near the breast is called a regional recurrence.
  * Cancer that returns to distant parts of the body is called metastatic breast cancer.
  * Treatment is based on where the cancer has returned and what type of treatment you had before.
  * Surgery followed by systemic therapy and radiation therapy is possible for a locoregional recurrence. Systemic and endocrine therapy options are based on hormone receptor (HR) and HER2 status, and any mutations found.
  * An unresectable tumor cannot be removed with surgery. Unresectable recurrent disease is treated as metastatic disease with systemic therapy.

# Questions to ask

  * Where is the cancer located and what does this mean for my treatment options?
  * Which course of treatment do you recommend and why?
  * Is surgery an option? What treatment might I have before and after surgery?
  * What role do previous treatments, my age, menopause status, and overall health play in treatment options?
  * Am I a candidate for a clinical trial?
