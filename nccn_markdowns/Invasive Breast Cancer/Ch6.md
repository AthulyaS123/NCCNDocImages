# Surgery first

Surgery is the main or primary treatment for invasive breast cancer. It involves removing the tumor from the breast and assessing the lymph nodes.

There are 2 breast surgery options:

  * Lumpectomy
  * Mastectomy

Surgery might include axillary lymph node (ALN) staging with either sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), or both. After surgery, a pathologist will examine the removed tissue and any lymph nodes to determine the pathologic stage. This information will help plan next steps for treatment. Treatment after surgery might include systemic therapy, radiation therapy, or both.

An example of a tumor stage after surgery might be pT2. Lymph node micrometastases are written as pN1mi. Ipsilateral means on the same side of the body.

# Lumpectomy first

A lumpectomy, also called breast-conserving surgery (BCS), is surgery to remove a tumor in the breast. Treatment after a lumpectomy is based on the type of cancer (histology), the size of the tumor, if cancer is found in the axillary lymph nodes, your age, and if you are in menopause. Many factors play a role in treatment decisions. Most people have radiation therapy (RT) to the breast and sometimes lymph nodes after a lumpectomy. A boost is extra radiation to the tumor area. Systemic (drug) therapy might be given before RT.

# Mastectomy first

A total mastectomy is a surgery that removes the whole breast. A nipple-sparing or skin-sparing mastectomy may be possible. Treatment after a mastectomy is based on if cancer was found in the axillary lymph nodes, the number of lymph nodes that tested positive, and the size of the removed tumor. Radiation therapy to the chest wall and lymph nodes, systemic therapy, or both are possible following a mastectomy.

# Systemic therapy before surgery

Some cancers benefit from treatment before surgery. These cancers include those with large tumors, aggressive tumors, cancer in the lymph nodes called nodal or node-positive $(N^{+})$ disease, or the cancer that involves the breast skin or chest wall. Treatment before surgery is called preoperative or neoadjuvant therapy.

# Testing

Not everyone will benefit from preoperative therapy. If preoperative systemic therapy is an option for you, then you will have blood and imaging tests before starting treatment. Testing will include an axillary lymph node exam. An ultrasound and biopsy of lymph nodes suspected of cancer are possible.

You will have the following before starting preoperative systemic therapy:

  * Core biopsy of breast
  * Placement of clips or markers to help the surgeon know where to operate in case the tumor goes away with preoperative therapy. Clips are also placed at the time of surgery for radiation planning.
  * Axillary lymph node ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (if not done before)
  * Biopsy of suspicious lymph nodes with clip placement (if not done before)

# Order of treatments

Most people with cancer will receive more than one type of treatment. Below is an overview words you might hear to describe treatment.

  * **Preoperative or neoadjuvant (before) therapy** is given to shrink the tumor before a primary treatment such as surgery.
  * **Perioperative therapy** is systemic therapy, such as chemotherapy, given before and after surgery.
  * **Primary treatment** is the main treatment given to rid the body of cancer.
  * **Postoperative or adjuvant (after) therapy** is given after primary treatment to rid the body of any cancer cells left behind from surgery. It is also used when the risk of cancer returning (recurrence) is felt to be high.
  * **First-line therapy** is the first set of systemic (drug) treatment given.
  * **Second-line therapy** is the next set of treatment given if cancer progresses during or after systemic therapy.

Talk to your care team about your treatment plan and what it means for your stage and type of cancer.

**Treatment before surgery**
Treatment before surgery is systemic (drug) therapy. It is based on hormone receptor (HR) and HER2 status. Preoperative systemic therapy has benefits. The goal is to shrink the tumor or the amount of cancer before surgery. How the tumor responds to drug therapy may also affect treatments after surgery.

# Surgery

Surgery options depend on how your cancer responded to preoperative therapy. A complete response means there is no evidence of cancer. In a partial response, the tumor in the breast or lymph nodes has shrunk in size. The choice between a lumpectomy or mastectomy is based on the size and location of the tumor, the size of your breast before surgery, and your preference.

If you had preoperative therapy, your tumor will be restaged using tissue removed during surgery. This is called the pathologic (p) stage or surgical stage. It might look like this: ypT2N1. The y means you had preoperative therapy. Treatment after surgery might be systemic therapy or radiation or both. It will likely include endocrine therapy if your tumor is HR+.

# Surgery is not an option

Surgery is not always possible. Even though surgery might not be an option, systemic therapy will continue. If the cancer is not responding to systemic therapy, then radiation may be considered to try to make the cancer resectable (able to be removed with surgery). The goal of treatment is to reduce the amount of cancer. Talk with your care team about your goals of treatment and your treatment preferences. Your wishes are always important.

> "Take things one day or even one step at a time, it might get harder before it gets better, but it will get better."

# Systemic therapy after surgery

Adjuvant systemic therapy is drug treatment after surgery. It is given to kill any remaining cancer cells and to help reduce the risk of cancer returning. This treatment is based on cancer stage, including lymph node (nodal) hormone receptor (HR), and HER2 status.

Systemic therapy options are based on the tumor type (histology), tumor HR and HER2 status, and if you are in menopause. Systemic therapies might be used alone or in combination. Ask your care team why one treatment might be preferred over another for your type of cancer.

For those in menopause (natural or induced), bone-strengthening therapy might be given to reduce the risk of distant metastasis.

## Favorable histologies

A tumor with a favorable histology is one that has a good prognosis. A prognosis is the course your cancer will likely take. These tumor types are not high grade, are HER2-, and might respond better to treatment than other tumors. They also might have less risk of returning. Ask your care team what this might mean for your treatment. Those with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) tumors will likely have endocrine therapy. Other systemic therapies or radiation therapy are possible.

Favorable histology includes the following:

  * Pure tubular
  * Pure mucinous
  * Pure cribriform
  * Adenoid cystic (conventional), secretory carcinoma, and other salivary carcinomas
  * Rare low-grade forms of metaplastic carcinoma
  * Other rare forms

## Common histologies

Ductal and lobular carcinoma are the most common types of invasive breast cancer.

Common histology includes the following:

  * Ductal/no special type (NST) (NST includes medullary pattern, cancers with neuroendocrine expression, and other rare patterns)
  * Lobular
  * Mixed
  * Micropapillary
  * Metaplastic (includes various subtypes)

# 21-gene assay

A 21-gene assay (such as Oncotype Dx) is a tumor test used to predict if your cancer might benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in addition to endocrine therapy. There are other tests that might be helpful, but a 21-gene assay is the only test proven to predict who would benefit from chemotherapy.

## What's next?

The next pages describe systemic therapy treatment based on tumor HR and HER2 status for common histologies. Typically, the systemic therapy options are the same before and after surgery. Ask your care team for more information.

## HR+ with HER2+

HR+ with HER2+ breast cancer is sometimes called triple-positive breast cancer. It is treated with HER2-targeted therapy and endocrine therapy. A CDK4/6 inhibitor may be added.

  * Chemotherapy with a HER2-targeted therapy is used to treat HER2+ cancer. Trastuzumab and pertuzumab are examples of HER2-targeted therapy. HER2-targeted therapy options can be found in **Guide 4**.
  * Endocrine therapy is used to treat HR+ breast cancer. It is given after chemotherapy. Endocrine therapy options for HR+ cancer can be found in **Guide 6**.

## HR+ with HER2-

HER2-targeting therapy is not used when the tumor is HER2-negative (HER2-). Sometimes, chemotherapy is used. When cancer is found in the lymph nodes, it is node positive (node+).

  * If chemotherapy is given, it is given before endocrine therapy. Chemotherapy and other systemic therapies specific to HER2- breast cancer can be found in **Guide 5**.
  * Those who are premenopausal might have ovarian suppression or ablation in addition to endocrine therapy. Endocrine therapy options for HR+ cancer can be found in **Guide 6**.

## HR- with HER2+

In HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer, tumor cells have a larger than normal number of HER2 receptors. Since this cancer is HR- and HER2+, treatment focuses on targeting HER2. HER2-targeted therapy usually includes chemotherapy. HER2-targeted therapy options can be found in **Guide 4**.

# Triple-negative breast cancer

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the tumor tested negative for HER2, estrogen receptors, and progesterone receptors. It is written as ER- and/or PR- with HER2-. There are many variations within TNBC. It is a group of diseases that we are learning more about all the time. This cancer is treated with chemotherapy and other systemic therapies found in **Guide 5**.

# Endocrine therapy

Endocrine therapy is used to treat hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer. This is cancer that tests positive for estrogen receptors (ER+), progesterone receptors (PR+), or both $(ER+/PR+)$. Endocrine therapy blocks estrogen and progesterone, which can slow tumor growth or shrink the tumor for a period of time. It might also help prevent the risk of cancer returning in the breasts and elsewhere in the body.

## Guide 6: Endocrine therapy options: HR+ cancer

| Status at diagnosis | Option | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Premenopause at diagnosis** | **Option 1** | • Tamoxifen alone or with ovarian suppression or ablation for 5 years |
| **Premenopause at diagnosis** | **Option 1 (cont.)** | After 5 years, if in postmenopause, then an aromatase inhibitor for 5 years or consider tamoxifen for another 5 years (for a total of 10 years on tamoxifen) |
| **Premenopause at diagnosis** | **Option 1 (cont.)** | After 5 years, if still in premenopause, then consider tamoxifen for another 5 years (for a total of 10 years on tamoxifen) or stop endocrine therapy |
| **Premenopause at diagnosis** | **Option 2** | • Aromatase inhibitor for 5 years with ovarian suppression or ablation, then consider aromatase inhibitor for an additional 3 to 5 years |
| **Menopause at diagnosis** | **Option 1** | • Aromatase inhibitor for 5 years, then consider aromatase inhibitor for 3 to 5 more years<br>• Aromatase inhibitor for 2 to 3 years, then tamoxifen to complete 5 years total of endocrine therapy<br>• Tamoxifen for 2 to 3 years, then an aromatase inhibitor to complete 5 years of endocrine therapy<br>• Tamoxifen for 2 to 3 years, then up to 5 years of an aromatase inhibitor |
| **Menopause at diagnosis** | **Option 2** | • Tamoxifen for 4.5 to 6 years, then an aromatase inhibitor for 5 years or consider tamoxifen for another 5 years (for a total of 10 years on tamoxifen) |
| **Menopause at diagnosis** | **Option 3** | • For those who can't have aromatase inhibitors or who don't want aromatase inhibitors, take tamoxifen for 5 years or consider tamoxifen for up to 10 years |

  * If chemotherapy is given, it is given before endocrine therapy.
  * Those with high-risk breast cancer that is HR+ and HER2- might have endocrine therapy with 2 years of adjuvant abemaciclib or 3 years of ribociclib.
  * Those receiving an aromatase inhibitor (AI) who are at risk for osteoporosis will likely have bone density tests and bone-strengthening therapy.
  * Endocrine therapy options for HR+ cancer can be found in **Guide 6**.

# Follow-up care

After treatment, you will receive follow-up care. During this time, your health will be monitored for side effects of treatment (late effects) and the possible return of cancer (recurrence).

It is important to keep any follow-up care and imaging test appointments. Seek routine medical care, including regular doctor visits for preventive care and cancer screening. Find out who will coordinate with specialists for your follow-up care.

Tell your care team about any symptoms such as headaches, menstrual spotting between periods or new onset of spotting after menopause (if prior tamoxifen use), shortness of breath that you notice with walking, or bone pain. Side effects can be managed. Continue to take all medicine such as endocrine therapy exactly as prescribed and do not miss or skip doses.

Follow-up care can be found in **Guide 7**.

## Guide 7: Follow-up care

  * Medical history and physical exam 1 to 4 times a year as needed for 5 years, then every year
  * Screen for distress, anxiety, depression, and changes in family history
  * Genetic testing and referral to genetic counseling, as needed
  * Monitor for lymphedema and refer for lymphedema management, as needed
  * Mammogram every 12 months (not needed for the side that underwent a mastectomy or on reconstructed breast)
  * Discuss any issues or questions related to fertility, birth control, or sexual health
  * Heart tests, as needed
  * Information on risk of future health issues (comorbidities)
  * If signs and symptoms of metastases, then blood and imaging tests
  * If taking endocrine therapy, continue to take endocrine therapy. Do not miss or skip doses
  * Annual gynecology exam (depending on age)
  * Bone density tests for those on an aromatase inhibitor or who later have ovarian issues
  * Maintain an ideal body weight (BMI of 20 to 25), be active, eat a mostly plant-based diet, exercise, limit alcohol, and quit smoking/vaping nicotine
