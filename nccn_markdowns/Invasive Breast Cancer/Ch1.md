# What is invasive breast cancer?

Breast cancer starts in the cells of the breast. Over time, these cells form a mass called a tumor. In invasive breast cancer, cancer has grown outside the milk ducts or milk glands (lobules) into the surrounding breast tissue.

Invasive breast cancer is cancer that has spread from the milk ducts or milk glands (lobules) into the surrounding breast tissue or nearby lymph nodes. Invasive breast cancer is also called early-stage breast cancer.

Once outside the ducts or lobules, breast cancer can spread through lymph or blood to lymph nodes or other parts of the body.

Almost all invasive breast cancers are carcinomasâ€”cancers that start in the cells that line the inner or outer surfaces of the body. There are different types of breast carcinoma, most of which arise in cells that make up the lining (epithelial cells) in the terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs) of the breast. A TDLU consists of a lobule connected to the end of a small milk duct. The most common types of invasive breast cancer are ductal carcinoma and lobular carcinoma.

Anyone can develop breast cancer, including those assigned male at birth. Although there are some differences between breast cancers in those assigned male and those assigned female at birth, treatment is very similar for all genders.

**The breast**
The breast is a glandular organ made up of milk ducts, fat, nerves, blood and lymph vessels, ligaments, and other connective tissue.

# What are the parts of the breast?

The breast is a gland found on the chest. The breast is made of milk ducts, fat, nerves, lymph and blood vessels, ligaments, and other connective tissue. Behind the breast are the pectoral (chest) muscle and ribs. Muscle and ligaments help hold the breast in place.

Breast tissue contains glands that can make milk. These milk glands are called lobules. Lobules look like tiny clusters of grapes. Small tubes called ducts connect the lobules to the nipple.

The ring of darker breast skin in the center of the breast is called the areola. The raised tip within the areola is called the nipple. The nipple-areola complex (NAC) is a term that refers to both parts.

Lymphatic fluid (lymph) drains from breast tissue into lymph vessels and travels to lymph nodes near your armpit (axilla). Lymph is a clear fluid that gives cells water and food. It also helps to fight germs. Nodes near the armpit are called axillary lymph nodes (ALNs). Cancer cells can travel through blood and lymph to lymph nodes and other parts of the body.

# What can you do to get the best care?

Advocate for yourself. You have an important role to play in your care. In fact, you're more likely to get the care you want by asking questions and making shared decisions with your care team. Consider seeking the opinion of a breast cancer specialist and team that specializes in diagnosis and management of breast cancer.

The NCCN Guidelines for Patients will help you understand cancer care. With better understanding, you'll be more prepared to discuss your care with your team and share your concerns. Many people feel more satisfied when they play an active role in their care.

You may not know what to ask your care team. That's common. Each chapter in this book ends with an important section called Questions to ask. These suggested questions will help you get more information on all aspects of your care.

Take the next step and keep reading to learn what is the best care for you\!
