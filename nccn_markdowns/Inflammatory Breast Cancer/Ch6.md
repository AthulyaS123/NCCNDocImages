# 6. Treatment before surgery

## How is IBC treated?

Since inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) spreads quickly, treatment starts with systemic (drug) therapy to stop the spread of cancer. Together, you and your care team will choose a treatment plan that is best for you.

IBC is treated with systemic therapy to shrink
the tumor, followed by surgery to remove the
breast and lymph nodes (modi¿ed radical
mastectomy), and then radiation therapy to
the chest wall. Surgery is not always possible.
Even though surgery might not be an option,
systemic therapy will continue.

If you choose breast reconstruction after a
mastectomy with radiation, then delayed
breast reconstruction is recommended.
Radiation can slow the healing process.
Therefore, it is better to wait until you have
healed from radiation therapy before having
breast reconstruction.

Treatment for IBC starts with preoperative
systemic (drug) therapy. Preoperative therapy
is treatment given before surgery. It is
based on HER2 and hormone receptor (HR)
expression status of the tumor cells.

Cancer can still progress during preoperative
systemic therapy. If cancer progresses, then
another systemic (drug) therapy will be given.

## HER2-negative (HER2–)

In HER2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer,
tumor cells do not express increased levels of
HER2. Chemotherapy is used to treat HER-
cancer. It might include another systemic
therapy. Systemic therapy options for HER2-
can be found in Guide 4.

Triple-negative breast cancer
In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the
tumor tested negative for HER2, estrogen
receptors, and progesterone receptors. It is
written as ER- and/or PR- with HER2-. This
cancer is treated with chemotherapy and other
systemic therapies found in Guide 4.

### Guide 4. Systemic therapy options for HER2– cancer

| Type of therapy | Options |
|-----------------|---------|
| Chemotherapy    | AC (doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide) followed by paclitaxel or docetaxel; TC (docetaxel, cyclophosphamide); dose-dense regimens |
| Immunotherapy (for TNBC) | Pembrolizumab + chemotherapy |
| PARP inhibitors (for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers) | Olaparib, talazoparib |
| Capecitabine   | May be used if residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy |

## HER2-positive (HER2+)

Inflammatory breast cancers often produce
greater than normal amounts of HER2. If the
tumor is HER2-positive (HER2+), then it is
treated with HER2-targeted therapy found in
Guide 5.

In triple-positive breast cancer, tumor cells
have estrogen receptors (ER+), progesterone
receptors (PR+), and a larger than normal
number of HER2 receptors on their surface.
It is treated with HER2-targeted therapy and
endocrine therapy. A CDK4/6 inhibitor may be
added. See Guide 5.

### Guide 5. Systemic therapy options for HER2+ cancer

| Type of therapy | Options |
|-----------------|---------|
| Chemotherapy + HER2 therapy | TCH (docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab); TCHP (docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab, pertuzumab) |
| HER2-targeted agents | Trastuzumab, pertuzumab, ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), neratinib, tucatinib |
| Combination therapy | Trastuzumab + pertuzumab + chemotherapy |

## Treatment response

The next treatment is based on how the tumor
responded to preoperative systemic therapy.
It is called preoperative (before surgery)
treatment because the goal is surgery, when
possible. Systemic therapy given after surgery
is called adjuvant therapy. Adjuvant systemic
therapy may be given after surgery to reduce
the chance of cancer recurrence.

A physical exam and imaging tests should be
done to assess how the cancer responded to
preoperative systemic therapy. Treatment will
be based on if the tumor can be removed with
surgery or if the tumor did not shrink enough to
be removed with surgery.

If surgery is possible, then a total mastectomy
with level I and II axillary lymph node
dissection is the recommended option.
Because IBC usually involves a large portion
of the breast, lumpectomy is not typically an
option. You may choose a delayed breast
reconstruction as part of the mastectomy.
Radiation therapy (RT) is part of this treatment.

After the mastectomy you will ¿nish
chemotherapy if you didn’t complete the
course before surgery and have radiation
therapy. Tumors that are estrogen receptor-
positive (ER+), progesterone receptor-positive
(PR+), or both (ER+/PR+) are treated with
endocrine therapy.

If the tumor is HER2+, then you will complete
up to one year of HER2-targeted therapy. This
may be given with RT and endocrine therapy.

Surgery is not always possible. Even though
surgery might not be an option, systemic
therapy will continue. If the cancer is not
responding to systemic therapy, then radiation
may be considered to try to make the
cancer resectable (able to be removed with
surgery). The goal of treatment is to reduce
the amount of cancer. Talk with your care
team about your goals of treatment and your
treatment preferences. Your wishes are always
important.

### Guide 6. Endocrine therapy options for ER+ cancers

| Patient group | Options |
|---------------|---------|
| Premenopausal | Tamoxifen; Ovarian suppression + tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor (AI) |
| Postmenopausal | Aromatase inhibitor (anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane); Fulvestrant (SERD) |
| All patients  | Consider CDK4/6 inhibitors in combination with endocrine therapy |

## Follow-up care

After treatment, you will receive follow-up care.
During this time, your health will be monitored
for side eႇects of treatment (late eႇects) and
the possible return of cancer (recurrence). It
is important to keep any follow-up care and
imaging test appointments. Seek routine
medical care, including regular doctor visits for
preventive care and cancer screening. Find
out who will coordinate with specialists for your
follow-up care.
Tell your care team about any symptoms
such as headaches, menstrual spotting
between periods or new onset of spotting after
menopause (if prior tamoxifen use), shortness
of breath while walking, or bone pain. Side
eႇects can be managed. Continue to take all
medicine such as endocrine therapy exactly as
prescribed and do not miss or skip doses.

### Guide 7. Follow-up care checklist

| Type of care | Recommendations |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Physical exam | 1–4 times/year for 5 years, then annually |
| Mammogram | Annually for any remaining breast tissue |
| Distress screening | Ongoing emotional and psychosocial support |
| Genetic counseling/testing | If family history or genetic risk present |
| Heart tests | For patients treated with HER2 drugs or anthracyclines |
| Gynecology exams | If taking tamoxifen |
| Bone density tests | If taking aromatase inhibitors |
| Lifestyle | Exercise, healthy diet, stop smoking, limit alcohol |

## Questions to ask

- What treatments do you recommend for me?  
- In what order will I receive these treatments?  
- What are my options if treatment doesn’t work?  
- Should I join a clinical trial?  
- What side effects should I expect?  
- How will I know if treatment is working?  
- What resources are available to help with cost?
