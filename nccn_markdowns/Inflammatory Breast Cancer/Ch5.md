# 5. Supportive care

## What is supportive care?

Supportive care helps manage the symptoms of inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) and the side effects of treatment. This chapter discusses possible side effects.

Supportive care helps improve your quality
of life during and after cancer treatment. The
goal is to prevent or manage side effects and
symptoms, like pain, nausea, and fatigue. It
also addresses the mental, social, and spiritual
concerns faced by those with cancer.

Supportive care is available to everyone with
cancer and their families, not just those at the
end of life. Palliative care is another name for
supportive care.

## Side effects
All cancer treatments can cause unwanted
health issues called side effects. Side effects
depend on many factors. These factors include
the drug type and dose, length of treatment,
and the person. Some side effects may just be
unpleasant. Others may be harmful to one’s
health. Treatment can cause several side
effects. Some are very serious. Tell your care
team about any new or worsening symptoms.

All cancer treatments can cause
unwanted health issues called side
effects. It is important to tell your
care team about all of your side
effects so they can be managed.


### Blood clots (VTE)
Cancer or cancer treatment can cause blood
clots to form. This can block blood flow and
oxygen in the body. Blood clots can break
loose and travel to other parts of the body
causing breathing problems, stroke, or other
health issues. Venous thromboembolism (VTE)
refers to blood clots in the veins.

### Bone health
Breast cancer may spread to your bones.
Some breast cancer treatments may also
weaken your bones. Both can put your bones
at increased risk for injury and disease. Such
problems include bone fractures, bone pain,
and squeezing (compression) of the spinal
cord. High levels of calcium in the blood, called
hypercalcemia, may also occur.

Medicine may be given to help relieve bone
pain and reduce the risk of other bone
problems. Some medicines work by slowing or
stopping bone breakdown, while others help
increase bone thickness. It is recommended
that you take calcium and vitamin D with these
bone health medicines. Talk to your care team.

### Diarrhea
Diarrhea is frequent and watery bowel
movements. Your care team will tell you how to
manage diarrhea. It is important to drink lots of
fluids.

---

### Distress
Depression, anxiety, and sleeping issues are
common and are a normal part of cancer
diagnosis. Talk to your care team and with
those whom you feel most comfortable about
how you are feeling. There are services,
people, and medicine that can help you.

---

### Fatigue
Fatigue is extreme tiredness and inability to
function due to lack of energy. Fatigue may
be caused by cancer or it may be a side effect
of treatment. Let your care team know how
you are feeling and if fatigue is getting in the
way of doing the things you enjoy. Eating a
balanced diet, exercise, yoga, acupuncture,
and massage therapy can help. You might be
referred to a nutritionist or dietitian to help with
fatigue.

### Hair loss
Chemotherapy may cause hair loss (alopecia)
all over your body—not just on your scalp.
Some chemotherapy drugs are more likely
than others to a hair loss. Dosage might
also affects the amount of hair loss. Most of
the time, hair loss from chemotherapy is
temporary. Hair often regrows 3 to 6 months
after treatment ends. Your hair may be a
different shade or texture at rst. Scalp cooling
(or scalp hypothermia) might help lessen
hair loss in those receiving certain types of
chemotherapy.

### Infections
Infections occur more frequently and are more
severe in those with a weakened immune
system. Drug treatment for breast cancer can
weaken the body’s natural defense against
infections. If not treated early, infections can be
fatal.

Neutropenia, a low number of white blood
cells can lead to frequent or severe infections.
When someone with neutropenia also
develops a fever, it is called febrile neutropenia
(FN). With FN, your risk of infection may be
higher than normal. This is because a low
number of white blood cells leads to a reduced
ability to fight infections. FN is a side effect of
some types of systemic therapy.

### Low appetite
Sometimes side effects from surgery, cancer,
or its treatment might cause you to feel not
hungry or sick to your stomach (nauseated).
You might have a sore mouth. Healthy eating
is important during treatment. It includes eating
a balanced diet, eating the right amount of
food, and drinking enough fluids. A registered
dietitian who is an expert in nutrition and food
can help. Speak to your care team if you have
trouble eating or maintaining weight.

### Low blood counts
- **Anemia** (low red blood cells) is a condition where your body
does not have enough healthy red blood
cells, resulting in less oxygen being
carried to your body tissues. You might
tire easily or feel short of breath if you are
anemic.
- **Neutropenia** is a decrease in neutrophils,
the most common type of white blood cell.
This puts you at risk for infection.
- **Thrombocytopenia** (low platelets) is a condition where
there are not enough platelets found
in the blood. This puts you at risk for
bleeding.

### Lymphedema
Lymphedema is a condition in which lymph
fluid builds up in tissues and causes swelling.
It may be caused when part of the lymph
system is damaged or blocked, such as
during surgery to remove lymph nodes, or by
radiation therapy. Cancers that block lymph
vessels can also cause lymphedema. Swelling
usually develops slowly over time. It may
develop during treatment, or it may start years
after treatment. If you have lymphedema, you
may be referred to an expert in lymphedema
management. The swelling may be reduced by
exercise, massage, compression devices, and
other means.

### Nausea and vomiting
Nausea and vomiting are common side effects of cancer treatment. Antiemetic medicines can help. Tell your care team if nausea or vomiting does not go away.  

---

### Neurological issues
Some treatments can damage the nervous
system (neurotoxicity) causing problems
with concentration and memory. Survivors
are at risk for neurotoxicity and might be
recommended for neuropsychological testing.
Neuropsychology looks at how the health of
your brain affects your thinking and behavior.
Neuropsychological testing can identify your
limits and doctors can create a plan to help
with these limits.

Some treatments can damage the nervous
system (neurotoxicity) causing neuropathy and
problems with concentration, memory, and
thinking. Neuropathy is a nerve problem that
causes pain, numbness, tingling, swelling, or
muscle weakness in different parts of the body.
It usually begins in the hands or feet and gets
worse with additional cycles of treatment. Most
of the time, neuropathy improves gradually and
may eventually go away after treatment.

### Organ issues
Treatment might cause your kidneys, liver,
heart, and pancreas to not work as well as
they should.

## Late effects

Late effects are side effects that occur months
or years after a disease is diagnosed or after
treatment has ended. Late effects may be
caused by cancer or cancer treatment. They
may include physical, mental, and social health
concerns, and second cancers. The sooner
late effects are treated the better. Ask the care
team about what late effects could occur. This
will help you know what to look for.

Tell your care team about any pain or
discomfort. You might meet with a palliative
care specialist or with a pain specialist to
manage pain. Palliative care is appropriate for anyone,
regardless of age, cancer stage, or the need
for other therapies. It focuses on physical,
emotional, social, and spiritual needs that
affect quality of life.

A person is a cancer survivor from the time of
diagnosis until the end of life. After treatment,
your health will be monitored for side effects
of treatment and the return of cancer. This
is part of your survivorship care plan. It is
important to keep any follow-up care and
imaging test appointments. Seek good routine
medical care, including regular doctor visits for
preventive care and cancer screening.
