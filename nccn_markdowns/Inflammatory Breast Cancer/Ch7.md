# 7. The breast after surgery

—

The recovery time for each procedure differs.
This can affect your ability to return to work
or participate in activities. You might consider
speaking with a plastic surgeon before surgery
to discuss your options and what to expect. A
plastic surgeon performs breast reconstruction.


## Flat closure

In a total mastectomy with a flat closure, the
entire breast, including nipple, extra skin,
fat, and other tissue in the breast area, is
removed. The remaining skin is tightened
and sewn together. No breast mound is
created, and no implant is added. The scar
will be slightly raised and differ in color than
the surrounding skin. A flat closure is not
completely flat or smooth. The result varies
from person to person. Ask to look at pictures
from flat closures so you know what to expect.

You might decide to have a flat closure
procedure later or after having breast implants
removed. Talk to your care team to learn more.

## Breast reconstruction

Breast reconstruction is surgery to rebuild
the shape and look of the breast after
a mastectomy. In many cases, breast
reconstruction involves a staged approach. It
might require more than one procedure.


You may have a choice as to when
breast reconstruction is done. Immediate
reconstruction is finished within hours after
removing the breast. Delayed reconstruction
can occur months or years after the cancer
surgery. Reconstruction can also be done in
stages, with part of the reconstruction done
at the time of the original cancer surgery and
finished with another surgery later. A plastic
surgeon performs breast reconstruction.

Breasts can be reconstructed with implants
and flaps. All methods are generally safe,
but as with any surgery, there are risks. Ask
your treatment team for a complete list of side
Effects.

Breast implants are small bags filled with salt
water, silicone gel, or both. They are placed
under the breast skin or muscle to look like a
new breast following a mastectomy. A balloon-
like device, called an expander, may be used
first to stretch out tissue. It will be placed under
your skin or muscle and enlarged every few
weeks for 2 to 3 months. When your skin is
stretched to the proper size, you will have
surgery to place the final implant Implants have a small risk of leaking or
causing other issues. You may feel pain from
the implant or expander. Scar tissue or tissue
death can occur.

Breasts can be remade using skin from other
parts of your body, known as flaps. These flaps
are taken from the abdomen, buttocks, thigh,
or from under the shoulder blade. Some flaps
are completely removed and then sewn in
place. Other flaps stay attached to your body
but are slid over and sewn into place.

There are several risks associated with flaps,
including death of fat in the flap, which can
cause lumps. A hernia may result from muscle
weakness. Problems are more likely to occur
among those who have diabetes or who
smoke.

Some breasts are reconstructed with both
implants and flaps. This method may give the
reconstructed breast more volume to match
the other breast. For any reconstruction, you
may need surgery on your remaining breast to
match the size and shape of both breasts.

## Nipple replacement

Like your breast, a nipple can be remade. To
rebuild a nipple, a plastic surgeon can use
surrounding tissues. Also, nipples can be
remade with tissue from the thigh or the other
nipple. Tissue can be darkened with a tattoo to
look more like a nipple. It is important to know
that while you can remake something to look
like a nipple, it will not have the sensation of
your real nipple. Also, a tattoo can be done to
look like a nipple without having to take tissue
from another part of the body.

## What to consider

The decision to have reconstruction is personal. Some things to think about include:  

Your desire – You may have a strong
feeling towards flat closure or one form
of reconstruction after being given the
options. Breast reconstruction should be
a shared decision between you and your
care team. Make your wishes known.

Health issues – You may have health
issues such as diabetes or a blood
disorder that might affect or delay healing
or make longer procedures unsafe.

Tobacco use – Smoking delays wound
healing and can cause mastectomy flap
death (necrosis), nipple-areola complex
(NAC) necrosis in a nipple-sparing
mastectomy, infection, and failure of
implant-based reconstruction. In free flap
reconstruction, smoking increases the risk
of complications. You are encouraged to
stop smoking prior to reconstruction.

Breast size and shape – There are
limits to the available sizes of breast
implants. Very large breasts or breasts
that lack tone or droop (called ptosis)
might be difficult to match. Breast
reduction surgery might be an option.

Body mass index (BMI) – Those with
an elevated BMI have an increased risk of
infections and complications with breast
reconstruction.

## Key points

- Flat closure is an option after mastectomy.  
- Reconstruction can use implants or your own tissue.  
- Nipples can be rebuilt or tattooed, but will not have sensation.

## Note on smoking and vaping

Smoking and vaping can cause problems with wound healing and recovery. Quitting before surgery is strongly recommended.
