## Care team

Treating breast cancer takes a team approach.
Treatment decisions should involve a
multidisciplinary team (MDT). An MDT is a
team of health care and psychosocial care
professionals from different professional
backgrounds who have knowledge (expertise)
and experience in your type of cancer.
This team is united in the planning and
implementing of your treatment. Ask who will
coordinate your care.

Some members of your care team will be with
you throughout cancer treatment, while others
will only be there for parts of it. Get to know
your care team and help them get to know you.

## Treatment overview

Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is treatable.
Treatment can be local, systemic, or usually a
combination of both.


Local therapy focuses on the breast, chest
wall, and lymph node area. It includes:
Surgery (mastectomy and lymph node
surgery)
Radiation therapy (RT)

Systemic therapy works throughout the
body. It includes: Chemotherapy, HER2-targeted therapy, Inhibitors and other targeted therapies, Immunotherapy, Endocrine therapy

IBC is treated with systemic (drug) therapy
to shrink the tumor, followed by surgery to
remove the breast and lymph nodes, and
then radiation therapy. Surgery is not always
possible. Even though surgery might not be
an option, systemic therapy will continue.
Systemic treatment is based on estrogen
receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR),
and HER2 expression.

Many factors play a role in how the cancer will
respond to treatment. It is important to have
regular talks with your care team about your
goals for treatment and your treatment plan.

## Mastectomy

Surgery is an operation or procedure to remove
cancer from the body. A mastectomy removes
all or part of the breast. Inflammatory breast
cancer is often treated with a modified radical
mastectomy. In a modified radical mastectomy,
the breast and underarm (axilla) sentinel lymph
nodes (SLNs) are removed. Before removing
the breast, the surgeon may do a sentinel
lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Sentinel lymph
nodes are the first lymph nodes cancer cells
are likely to have spread from the primary
tumor.

Breast reconstruction is an option after a
mastectomy. If you opt for reconstruction, it
will be done after finishing cancer treatment.
This is called delayed reconstruction. Breast
reconstruction is often done in stages. You
might want to consult with a plastic surgeon.

When preparing for surgery, seek the opinion
of an experienced surgeon. The surgeon
should be an expert in performing your type of
surgery. Hospitals that perform many surgeries
often have better results. You can ask for a
referral to a hospital or cancer center that has
experience in treating your type of cancer.

## Lymph node surgery

### Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)
Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB or SNB) is
done during a lumpectomy or mastectomy to
determine if any cancer cells have traveled to
the lymph nodes. The lymph nodes removed
are called the sentinel nodes.

A sentinel lymph node (SLN) is the first lymph
node or nodes that cancer cells are most likely
to spread to from a primary tumor. Often, there
is more than one sentinel lymph node. Just
because these nodes are removed, it does not
mean that they test positive for cancer.

To sentinel lymph nodes, a dye is
injected into the breast. It may be a radioactive
material, blue dye, or other tracer. The tracer
travels through the lymph channels in the
breast to the lymph nodes in the armpit.
This helps the surgeon and which of the lymph nodes are the sentinel lymph nodes.
The lymph nodes containing the tracer are
removed and tested by a pathologist.
 

### Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND)
Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is
surgery to remove axillary lymph nodes. This is
performed after an axillary lymph node biopsy
or SLNB shows cancer in the lymph nodes
(called node positive). Then, an ALND will
remove any other lymph nodes that contain
cancer. Removing lymph nodes can cause
lymphedema (fluid buildup) and other health
issues.

When the axillary nodes are removed with
the breast, it is called a modified radical
Mastectomy.

There are 3 levels of axillary lymph nodes:
Level I – nodes located below the lower
edge of the chest muscle
Level II – nodes located underneath the
chest muscle
Level III – nodes located above the
chest muscle near the collarbone

## Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy
radiation from x-rays (photons), protons, and
other sources to kill cancer cells and shrink
tumors. Radiation therapy can be given alone
or before or after surgery to treat or slow
cancer growth. Sometimes, radiation is given
with certain systemic (drug) therapies. It may
be used as supportive care to help ease pain
or discomfort caused by cancer. Treatment is
given in small daily doses on weekdays, with
weekends off (confirm with your doctor!!!).

You will see your radiation oncologist at least
weekly to review treatment results and to help
with side effects, such as sunburn-like rash.
Ask your care team which radiation option(s)
are best for your situation, if RT will be
combined with chemotherapy, and what side
effects to expect.

The following are types of radiation therapy
used to treat breast cancer:
Whole breast radiation therapy (WBRT) is used to treat the entire breast.
Lymph node radiation therapy is
used to treat the lymph nodes. It is also
called regional nodal irradiation (RNI).

Radiation may be given to the breast and
chest wall, infraclavicular region (below the
collarbone), supraclavicular area (above the
collarbone), or lymph nodes found inside the
breast (intramammary), behind the ribcage
(internal mammary), or axillary bed (armpit).

External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) uses
a machine outside of the body called a linear
accelerator (linac) to aim radiation at the whole
breast (called whole breast radiation therapy
or WBRT) and lymph nodes (called regional
nodal irradiation or RNI).

## Systemic therapy

Systemic therapy is drug therapy that works
throughout the body. It is used before surgery
to shrink the tumor or reduce the amount of
cancer (called cancer burden).
Preoperative or neoadjuvant
therapy is systemic therapy given before
surgery.

Postoperative or adjuvant therapy
is systemic therapy given after surgery.


### Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy kills fast-dividing cells
throughout the body, including cancer
cells and some normal cells. More than
one chemotherapy may be used to treat
inflammatory breast cancer. When only one
drug is used, it’s called a single agent. A combination or multi-agent regimen is the use
of two or more chemotherapy drugs. Some chemotherapy drugs are liquids given
through a vein (IV) or injected under the skin with a needle. Other chemotherapy drugs may be given as a pill that is swallowed. 
Anthracyclines include doxorubicin
(Adriamycin), doxorubicin liposomal
injection (Doxil), and epirubicin (Ellence).

Taxanes include docetaxel, paclitaxel,
and albumin-bound paclitaxel.

Antimetabolites include capecitabine
(Xeloda), fluorouracil, gemcitabine, and
methotrexate.

Most chemotherapy is given in cycles of
treatment days followed by days of rest.
This allows the body to recover before the
next cycle. Cycles vary in length depending
on which drugs are used. The number of
treatment days per cycle and the total number
of cycles given also vary.


### Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs)
An antibody drug conjugate (ADC) delivers
cell-specific chemotherapy. It attaches to a
protein found on the outside of the cancer
cell, then enters the cell. Once inside the
cell, chemotherapy is released. ADCs are
given in cycles. ADC examples include
ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla),
fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (Enhertu,
T-DXd), and sacituzumab govitecan-hziy
(Trodelvy).

### HER2-targeted therapy
HER2 is a protein involved in normal cell
growth. There might be higher amounts of
HER2 in your breast cancer. If this is the case,
it is called HER2-positive (HER2+) breast
cancer. HER2-targeted therapy is drug therapy
that treats HER2+ breast cancer. Some HER2-
targeted therapy is given with chemotherapy.
However, it might be used alone or in
combination with endocrine therapy.

HER2 antibodies prevent HER2 growth
signals from outside the cell. They also
increase the attack of immune cells on
cancer cells.
HER2 inhibitors stop HER2 growth
signals from within the cell.
HER2 conjugates or HER2 antibody
drug conjugates (ADCs) deliver cell-
specific chemotherapy. They attach
directly to HER2s then enter the cell.
Once inside, chemotherapy is released.
Your heart will be monitored before and
during treatment with HER2-targeted therapy.
Tests will measure the left ventricular ejection
fraction (LVEF), the amount of blood pumping
from the left side of the heart.

You might be asked to stop taking or avoid
certain herbal supplements when on a
systemic therapy. Some supplements can
affect the ability of a drug to do its job. This
is called a drug interaction.

It is critical to speak with your care team
about any supplements you may be
taking. Some examples include: Turmeric, Ginkgo biloba, Green tea extract, St. John’s Wort, Antioxidants

Certain medicines can also affect the
ability of a drug to do its job. Antacids,
heart or blood pressure medicine, and
antidepressants are just some of the
medicines that might interact with a
systemic therapy or supportive care
medicines given during systemic therapy.
Therefore, it is very important to tell your
care team about any medicines, vitamins,
over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, herbals, or
supplements you are taking.



### Other targeted therapies
These target specific changes in the cancer, such as:  
- CDK4/6 inhibitors: Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) is a cell
protein that helps cells grow and divide. For
hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-
negative (HER2-) cancer, taking a CDK4/6
inhibitor with endocrine therapy may help
control cancer longer and improve survival.
With all CDK4/6 regimens, those who are
premenopausal must also receive ovarian
ablation or suppression. CDK4/6 inhibitors
include abemaciclib (Verzenio), palbociclib
(Ibrance), and ribociclib (Kisqali).

- PARP inhibitors: Cancer cells often become damaged. PARP
is a cell protein that repairs cancer cells and
allows them to survive. Blocking PARP can
cause cancer cells to die. Olaparib (Lynparza)
and talazoparib (Talzenna) are examples of a
PARP inhibitor (PARPi).
  
- PIK3CA, PTEN, and AKT1
inhibitors: The PIK3CA gene is one of the most frequently
mutated genes in breast cancers. PTEN and
AKT are also part of this important pathway in
cancer cells and can be altered less commonly
in breast cancers. A mutation or alteration in
these genes can lead to increased growth
of cancer cells and resistance to various
treatments. Alpelisib (Piqray) is an example of
a PIK3CA inhibitor and capivasertib (Truqap) is
an AKT1 inhibitor.
  
mTOR inhibitors: mTOR is a cell protein that helps cells grow
and divide. Endocrine therapy may stop
working if mTOR becomes overactive. mTOR
inhibitors are used to get endocrine therapy
working again.


### Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy is a type of systemic treatment
that tries to reactivate the immune system
against tumor cells. The immune system
has many on and off switches. Tumors take
advantage of off switches. Immunotherapy
can block these off switches, which helps
the immune system turn on. Immunotherapy
can be given alone or with other types of
treatment. Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and
dostarlimab-gxly (Jemperli) are examples of
immunotherapy.


### Endocrine therapy
Endocrine therapy blocks estrogen or
progesterone to treat hormone receptor-
positive (HR+) breast cancer. The endocrine
system is made up of organs and tissues that
produce hormones. Hormones are natural
chemicals released into the bloodstream.

Estrogen is made mainly by the ovaries,
but is also made by other tissues in the
body such as fat tissue.
Progesterone is made mainly by the
ovaries.
Luteinizing hormone-releasing
hormone (LHRH) is made by a part
of the brain called the hypothalamus. It
tells the ovaries to make estrogen and
progesterone and testicles to make
testosterone. LHRH is also called
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).
Androgen is made by the adrenal
glands, testicles, and ovaries.
Hormones may cause breast cancer to
grow. Endocrine therapy will stop your body
from making hormones or it will block what
hormones do in the body. This can slow tumor
growth or shrink the tumor for a period of time.
Endocrine therapy is sometimes called
hormone therapy or anti-estrogen. It is not the
same as hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
used for menopause.
Endocrine therapy will suppress the production
of hormones and affect one's ability to become
pregnant during treatment. Those who want to
have children in the future should be referred
to a fertility specialist before starting endocrine
therapy.

For those assigned male at birth whose bodies
continue to make testosterone, endocrine
therapy includes tamoxifen or an aromatase
inhibitor (AI) with a testosterone-suppressing
therapy.

If you have menstrual periods, you are
in premenopause. In premenopause, the
ovaries are the main source of estrogen and
progesterone.

GnRH agonists may be used to
temporarily induce menopause for those
in premenopause. A combination of GnRH
agonists and tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors
may be considered as endocrine therapy for
those in premenopause. Ovarian suppression
or ablation is frequently considered for higher
risk ER+ breast cancers.

In menopause, the ovaries permanently
stop producing hormones and menstrual
periods stop. Estrogen and progesterone
levels are low, but the adrenal glands, liver,
and body fat continue to make small amounts
of estrogen. If you don’t have periods, a test using a blood sample.

### Bone-strengthening therapy
Medicines that target the bones may be given
to help relieve bone pain or reduce the risk of
bone-related problems. Some medicines work
by slowing or stopping bone breakdown, while
others help increase bone thickness.

When breast cancer spreads to distant sites,
it may metastasize in your bones. This puts
your bones at risk for injury and disease. Such
problems include fractures, bone pain, high
calcium levels in the blood, and squeezing
(compression) of the spinal cord. Some
treatments for breast cancer, like aromatase
inhibitors or GnRH agonists, can cause bone
loss (osteoporosis), which puts you at an
increased risk for fractures.

Drugs used to prevent bone loss and fractures: Oral bisphosphonates, Zoledronic acid (Zometa), Pamidronate (Aredia), Denosumab (Prolia)

Drugs used to treat bone metastases: Zoledronic acid (Zometa), Pamidronate (Aredia), Denosumab (Xgeva)

You may be screened for bone weakness
(osteoporosis) using a bone mineral density
test. This measures how much calcium and
other minerals are in your bones. It is also
called a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry
(DEXA) scan and is painless. Bone mineral
density tests look for osteoporosis and help
predict your risk for bone fractures.

Zoledronic acid, pamidronate, and
denosumab
Zoledronic acid, pamidronate, and denosumab
are used to prevent bone loss (osteoporosis)
and fractures caused by endocrine therapy.
Zoledronic acid and denosumab are also
used in those with metastatic inflammatory
breast cancer who have bone metastases
to help reduce the likelihood of fractures,
pain, or other complications arising from
cancer in bone. You might have blood tests to
monitor kidney function, calcium levels, and
magnesium levels. A calcium and vitamin D
supplement will likely be recommended by
your doctor.

Let your dentist know if you are taking any of
these medicines. Also, ask your care team
how these medicines might affect your teeth
and jaw. Osteonecrosis, or bone tissue death
of the jaw, is a rare but serious side effect. Tell
your care team about any planned trips to the
dentist and surgeries or dental procedures
that might also affect the jawbone. It will be
important to take care of your teeth and to see
a dentist before starting treatment with any of
these drugs.

## Clinical trials

Clinical trials test new treatments to see if they are safe and effective.  

- **Phase I**: trials study the safety and
side effects of an investigational drug or
treatment approach.
- **Phase II**: trials study how well the drug or
approach works against a specific type of
cancer.
- **Phase III**: trials test the drug or approach
against a standard treatment. If the
results are good, it may be approved by
the FDA.
- **Phase IIIl**: trials study the safety and
benefit of an FDA-approved treatment.

It depends on the clinical trial’s rules, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. They ensure that participants
are alike in specific ways and that the trial is as
safe as possible for the participants.

Clinical trials are managed by a research
team. This group of experts will review the
study with you in detail, including its purpose
and the risks and benefits of joining. All of this
information is also provided in an informed
consent form. Read the form carefully and
ask questions before signing it. Take time to
discuss it with people you trust. Keep in mind
that you can leave and seek treatment outside
of the clinical trial at any time.
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment, or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

There is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The
study sponsor pays for research-related costs,
including the study drug. But you may need
to pay for other services, like transportation or
childcare, due to extra appointments. During
the trial, you will continue to receive standard
cancer care. This care is often covered by
insurance.
