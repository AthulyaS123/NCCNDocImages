# 3. Types of treatment

---

## Care team

Treating breast cancer takes a team approach.
Treatment decisions should involve a
multidisciplinary team (MDT). An MDT is a
team of health care and psychosocial care
professionals from diႇerent professional
backgrounds who have knowledge (expertise)
and experience in your type of cancer.
This team is united in the planning and
implementing of your treatment. Ask who will
coordinate your care.

Surgery is an operation or procedure to
remove cancer from the body. Surgery is the
main or primary treatment for ductal carcinoma
in situ (DCIS). This is only one part of a
treatment plan. When preparing for surgery,
seek the opinion of an experienced surgeon.
The surgeon should be an expert in performing
your type of surgery. Hospitals that perform
many surgeries often have better results. You
can ask for a referral to a hospital or cancer
center that has experience in treating your type
of cancer.

The goal of surgery or tumor resection is to
remove all the cancer. To do so, the tumor is
removed along with a rim of normal-looking
tissue around its edge called the surgical
margin. The surgical margin may look normal
during surgery, but cancerous cells may be
found when viewed under a microscope by a
pathologist. A clear or negative margin (R0) is
when no cancer cells are found in the tissue
around the edge of the tumor. In a positive
margin, cancer cells are found in normal-
looking tissue around the tumor.

After surgery, you may receive treatment such
as radiation to kill any remaining cancer cells.
You might have a wound drain to prevent Àuid
from collecting in the body after surgery. These
drains are usually removed a few days after
surgery.

## Lumpectomy

Lumpectomy is the removal of abnormal cells
or tumor. It does not remove the whole breast.
A lumpectomy is also called breast-conserving
therapy or breast-conserving surgery (BCS).
In a lumpectomy, the surgeon aims to remove
all DCIS with a rim of healthy tissue around
it, called a negative, or clear, surgical margin.
Having a negative surgical margin will
decrease the chance that cancer may return
in that area of the breast. You may need more
than one surgery to achieve negative margins
and ensure all the cancer was removed. A
lumpectomy is usually followed by radiation
therapy to part of or the whole breast. It is
important to note that a lymph node biopsy is
not done with a lumpectomy.

The breast might not look the same after a
lumpectomy. Speak to your surgeon about how
a lumpectomy might aႇect the look and shape
of your breast, and any concerns you have.
You can also seek the opinion of a plastic
surgeon.

## Mastectomy

A **mastectomy** A mastectomy removes all of the breast. In
some cases, the surgeon may do a sentinel
lymph node biopsy (SLNB) before removing
the breast. Sentinel lymph nodes are the first
lymph nodes cancer cells are likely to have
spread from the primary tumor.

-  A total mastectomy or simple
mastectomy removes the whole breast
with a Àat skin closure. 
-  A skin-sparing mastectomy removes
the breast but not all of the skin, in order
to have breast reconstruction that might
include Àaps and/or implants.  
-  Nipple-sparing mastectomy
preserves the nipple-areola complex
(NAC) as well as all of the skin. Not
everyone is a candidate for nipple-sparing
mastectomy based upon location of
cancer, breast size, and breast ptosis
(degree of drooping).

Breast reconstruction is an option after a
mastectomy. It might be done at the same
time as mastectomy (immediate) or at some
time following the completion of cancer
treatment (delayed). Breast reconstruction
is most commonly done in stages. If you are
considering breast reconstruction surgery,
it requires collaboration between a breast
surgeon and a reconstructive (plastic) surgeon.

## Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)

A sentinel lymph node (SLN) is the first lymph
node that cancer cells are most likely to spread
to from a primary tumor. Sometimes, there
can be more than one sentinel lymph node.
Removal of the sentinel lymph nodes during
surgery is called a sentinel lymph node biopsy
(SLNB or SNB). This procedure may be done
during surgery such as a mastectomy (surgery
to remove the breast) or lumpectomy (surgery
to remove the tumor) to determine if any
cancer cells have traveled to the lymph nodes.
The lymph nodes removed are called the
sentinel nodes. They may or may not contain
any cancer cells. Just because these nodes
are removed, it does not mean that they are
positive for cancer.

To find the sentinel lymph nodes, a radioactive
material and other dyes are injected into the
area where breast tumor is located. From
here, the dye travels through the lymphatics
in the breast to the lymph nodes. This helps
the surgeon find which of the nodes are
the sentinel lymph nodes. Once the nodes
are found, those containing the radioactive
material or dye are removed and tested by a
pathologist. If cancer is found, then more than
the sentinel lymph nodes may be removed.

## Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy
radiation from x-rays (photons), protons, and
other sources to kill any remaining cancer cells
after surgery. Diႇerent types of radiation can
be used for DCIS. Most types include several
short treatment sessions that are given once
daily over a few days to weeks. Ask your care
team which radiation option(s) are best for you
and what side eႇects to expect.

 Whole breast radiation therapy
(WBRT) is used to treat the entire breast.
Sometimes, additional treatments may be
given to the tumor area. This is called a
Boost.
 Partial breast irradiation (PBI) is
used to treat only the tumor area of the
breast. Accelerated partial breast
irradiation (APBI) is radiation given
over a shorter period of time.

External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) uses
a machine outside the body to aim radiation
at the whole breast (WBRT) or only the tumor
area of the breast (PBI).

Internal radiation (brachytherapy) involves
placing one or more small tubes into the
tumor area of the breast. A small radioactive
seed travels into the tube(s) and delivers
radiation to the tumor area of the breast from
inside the body. This type of radiation is used
only for PBI.

## Endocrine (hormone) therapy

Endocrine therapy blocks estrogen or
progesterone to treat hormone receptor-
positive (HR+) breast cancer. The endocrine
system is made up of organs and tissues that
produce hormones. Hormones are natural
chemicals released into the bloodstream.

 Estrogen is made mainly by the ovaries,
but is also made by other tissues in the
body such as fat tissue.
 Progesterone is made mainly by the
ovaries.
 Luteinizing hormone-releasing
hormone (LHRH) is made by a part
of the brain called the hypothalamus. It
tells the ovaries to make estrogen and
progesterone and testicles to make
testosterone. LHRH is also called
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).
 Androgen is made by the adrenal
glands, testicles, and ovaries.
Hormones may cause breast cancer to
grow. Endocrine therapy will stop your body
from making hormones or it will block what
hormones do in the body. This can slow tumor
growth or shrink the tumor for a period of time.

Endocrine therapy is sometimes called
hormone therapy or anti-estrogen. It is not the
same as hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
used for menopause.

Endocrine therapy will suppress the production
of hormones and aႇect one's ability to become
pregnant during treatment. Those who want to

For those assigned male at birth whose bodies
continue to make testosterone, endocrine
therapy includes tamoxifen or an aromatase
inhibitor with a testosterone-suppressing
therapy.

### Guide 1. Endocrine therapy options for DCIS

| Option     | Description |
|-------------------|---------|
| Bilateral oophorectomy     | Surgery to remove both ovaries. |
| Ovarian ablation    | Radiation to permanently stop the ovaries from making hormones.|
| Ovarian or testosterone suppression    | Drugs to temporarily stop the ovaries or testicles from making
hormones such as LHRH and GnRH.
• LHRH agonists include goserelin (Zoladex) and leuprolide
(Lupron Depot). These are injected every 4 or 12 weeks. They
do not aႇect estrogen made by the ovaries.
• GnRH agonists might be used to suppress ovarian hormone or
testosterone production.|
| Aromatase inhibitors(AIs) | Drugs to stop a type of hormone called androgen from changing
into estrogen by interfering with an enzyme called aromatase. They do not aႇect estrogen made by the ovaries. Nonsteroidal AIs include anastrozole (Arimidex) and letrozole (Femara). Exemestane (Aromasin) is a steroidal AI. |
| Estrogen receptor (ER) modulators or anti-estrogens    | • Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) block
estrogen from attaching to hormone receptors. Tamoxifen and
toremifene (Fareston) are SERMs.
• Selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs) block and
destroy estrogen receptors. Fulvestrant (Faslodex) and elacestrant
(Orserdu) are SERDs. |
| Hormones| Hormone examples include ethinyl estradiol, Àuoxymesterone, and
megestrol acetate (Megace). |

If you have menstrual periods, you are
in premenopause. In premenopause, the
ovaries are the main source of estrogen and
Progesterone.  Tamoxifen is the endocrine treatment
option for those in premenopause.
Ovarian suppression or ablation is
frequently considered for higher risk ER+
breast cancers.

In menopause, the ovaries permanently stop
producing hormones and menstrual periods
stop. Estrogen and progesterone levels are
low, but the adrenal glands, liver, and body fat
continue to make small amounts of estrogen.
If you don’t have periods, a test using a blood
sample may be used to confirm your status.  Tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor
is the endocrine treatment for those in
menopause. Aromatase inhibitors include
anastrozole (Arimidex), exemestane
(Aromasin), and letrozole (Femara).

If you become pregnant during radiation
therapy or endocrine therapy, it can cause birth
defects. Non-hormonal birth control methods
such as intrauterine devices (IUDs) and barrier
methods are preferred in those with a breast
cancer diagnosis. Types of barrier methods
include condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps,
and the contraceptive sponge.

## Clinical trials

A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in a
lab, potential new ways of treating cancer need
to be studied in people. If found to be safe and
eႇective in a clinical trial, a drug, device, or
treatment approach may be approved by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.
  Phase 1 trials study the safety and
side eႇects of an investigational drug or
treatment approach.
 Phase 2 trials study how well the drug or
approach works against a specific type of
cancer.
 Phase 3 trials test the drug or approach
against a standard treatment. If the
results are good, it may be approved by
the FDA.
 Phase 4 trials study the safety and
benefit of an FDA-approved treatment.
It depends on the clinical trial’s rules, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. They ensure that participants
are alike in specific ways and that the trial is as
safe as possible for the participants.
Clinical trials are managed by a research
team. This group of experts will review the
study with you in detail, including its purpose
and the risks and benefits of joining. All of this
information is also provided in an informed
consent form. Read the form carefully and
ask questions before signing it. Take time to
discuss it with people you trust. Keep in mind
that you can leave and seek treatment outside
of the clinical trial at any time.
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment, or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.
There is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The
study sponsor pays for research-related costs,
including the study drug. But you may need
to pay for other services, like transportation or
childcare, due to extra appointments. During
the trial, you will continue to receive standard
cancer care. This care is often covered by
insurance.

## Supportive care

Supportive care helps improve your quality
of life during and after cancer treatment. The
goal is to prevent or manage side eႇects and
symptoms, like pain and cancer-related fatigue.
It also addresses the mental, social, and
spiritual concerns faced by those with cancer.

Examples:  
- Counseling  
- Physical therapy  
- Pain management  
- Support groups  

Depression, anxiety, and sleeping issues are
common and are a normal part of cancer
diagnosis. Talk to your care team and with

Fatigue is extreme tiredness and inability to
function due to lack of energy. Fatigue may be
caused by cancer or it may be a side eႇect of
treatment. Let your care team know how you
are feeling and if fatigue is getting in the way of
doing the things you enjoy. Eating a balanced
diet, exercise, yoga, acupuncture, and massage
therapy can help. You might be referred to a
nutritionist or dietitian to help with fatigue.

Sometimes side eႇects from surgery, cancer,
or its treatment might cause you to feel not
hungry or sick to your stomach (nauseated).
You might have a sore mouth. Healthy eating
is important during treatment. It includes eating
a balanced diet, eating the right amount of
food, and drinking enough Àuids. A registered
dietitian who is an expert in nutrition and food
