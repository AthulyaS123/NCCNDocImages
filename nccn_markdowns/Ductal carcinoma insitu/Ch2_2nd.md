# 2. Testing for DCIS

---

## General health tests

### Medical History

A medical history is a record of all health
issues and treatments you have had in your
life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury and
when it happened. Bring a list of old and new
medicines and any over-the-counter (OTC)
medicines, herbals, or supplements you take.
Some supplements interact with and aႇect
medicines that your care team may prescribe. 
Tell your care team about any symptoms you
have. A medical history, sometimes called
a health history, will help determine which
treatment is best for you.

### Family History
Some cancers and other diseases can run in
families. Your doctor will ask about the health
history of family members who are blood
relatives. This information is called a family
history. Ask family members on both sides of
your family about their health issues like heart
disease, cancer, and diabetes, and at what
age they were diagnosed. It’s important to
know the specific type of cancer, or where the
cancer started, and if it is in multiple locations,
and if they had genetic testing.

### Physical exam
Check your temperature, blood pressure,
pulse, and breathing rate
Check your height and weight
Listen to your lungs and heart
Look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat
Feel and apply pressure to parts of your
body to see if organs are of normal size,
are soft or hard, or cause pain when touched.
Examine your breasts to look for lumps,
nipple discharge or bleeding, or skin
changes.
Feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your
neck, underarm, and groin.

—
Clinical breast exam (CBE) is a physical exam
of the bare breast performed by a health care
provider to check for lumps or other changes.
It is done while you are seated and/or lying
down. Your provider should take time to
palpate (feel) the entire breast, including the
armpit. A nurse or assistant might also be in
the room during the exam.


## Breast imaging

Breast imaging is used to look inside the breast.  

- **Mammogram**: A mammogram is a picture of the insides
of your breast. The pictures are made
using x-rays. A computer combines the
x-rays to make detailed pictures. A bilateral
mammogram includes pictures of both
breasts. Mammogram results are used to plan
treatment.

- **Breast MRI**: A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
uses radio waves and powerful magnets
to take pictures of the inside of the body. It
does not use x-rays, which means there is no
radiation delivered to your body during the
test. Because of the very strong magnets used
in the MRI machine, tell the technologist if you
have any metal in your body. During the test,
you will likely be asked to hold your breath for
10 to 20 seconds as the technician collects the
images.


• Screening mammograms are done
on a regular basis when there are no
signs or symptoms of breast cancer.
Results take a few days.
• Diagnostic mammograms are
used for those who have symptoms
such as a lump, pain, nipple thickening
or discharge, or whose breasts have
changed shape or size.
• Diagnostic mammograms are
also used to take a closer look at an
abnormal area found in a screening
mammogram.
A radiologist will evaluate the
diagnostic mammogram while you
wait so if additional testing is needed, it
can be done right away.

## Biopsy

A biopsy is the removal of a sample of tissue
from your body for testing. A pathologist will
examine the biopsy for cancer and write a
report called a pathology report. Ask questions
about your biopsy results and what it means
for your treatment.

- **Core needle biopsy**:  Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or
core biopsy (CB) uses needles of
diႇerent sizes to remove a sample of
tissue or Àuid. In a vacuum-assisted
core biopsy (VACB), suction is used
through a needle to remove the sample
using a special vacuum device.
- **Incisional biopsy**  removes a small
amount of tissue through a cut in the skin
or body.
- **Surgical (excisional) biopsy**: removes the entire
abnormal area. This is not the preferred
type of biopsy, but may be necessary
if other methods are not possible or
when the biopsy results don’t match the
expected findings. An excisional biopsy
is usually done under anesthesia in an
operating room.


One or more clips may be placed near the
breast tumor during a biopsy. The clips are
small, painless, and made of metal. They will
mark the site for future treatment and imaging.
The clips will stay in place until surgery. If the
area biopsied is benign, the clip will remain
in place to mark the biopsy site on future
imaging. The clips cause no problems, even
if they are left in place for a long time. You will
be able to go through airport security and have
an MRI.

Histology is the study of the anatomy
(structure) of cells, tissues, and organs under
a microscope. It is used to make treatment
decisions. Your pathology report will contain
information about histology. You may be
recommended to have an open biopsy
(surgery) to remove (excise) the tumor to
confirm histology, such as invasive ductal
carcinoma or invasive lobular carcinoma.
Talk to your health care provider for more
information on next steps.

## Estrogen receptor (ER) testing

Estrogen is a hormone that plays a role in
breast development. It is made by a gland in
your body. A receptor is a protein found inside
or on the surface of a cell. When substances
such as hormones attach (bind) to these
receptors, it causes changes within the cell.
When hormones, such as estrogen, attach to
receptors inside breast cancer cells, they can
cause cancer to grow. If found, these estrogen
receptors may be targeted using endocrine
therapy.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a special
staining process that involves adding a
chemical marker to cells. These cells are
then studied using a microscope. IHC can
find estrogen receptors in breast cancer cells.
A pathologist will measure how many cells
have estrogen receptors and the number
of estrogen receptors inside each cell. Test
results will either be estrogen receptor-positive
(ER+) or estrogen receptor-negative (ER-).

In estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast
cancer, IHC finds estrogen hormone receptors
in at least 1 out of every 100 cancer cells.
ER+ cancer cells may need estrogen to
grow. These cells may stop growing or die
with endocrine treatment to block estrogen
production or estrogen receptor signaling.

Estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) breast
cancer cells do not have estrogen hormone
receptors. These cancer cells do not need
estrogen to grow and continue to grow.
Therefore, estrogen-blocking treatment is not
eႇective.

HER2 testing is not used in the
diagnosis and treatment of DCIS.

## Genetic testing

About 1 out of 10 breast cancers are
hereditary. Depending on your family history or
other features of your cancer, your health care
provider might refer you for hereditary genetic
testing to learn more about your cancer. A
genetic counselor or trained provider will speak
with you about the results. Test results may be
used to guide treatment planning.
Genetic testing is done using blood or saliva
(spitting into a cup or a cheek swab). The goal
is to look for gene mutations inherited from
your biological (birth) parents called germline
mutations. Some mutations can put you at
risk for more than one type of cancer. You
can pass these genes on to your children.
Also, other family members might carry these
mutations. Tell your care team if there is a
family history of cancer.

Some cancers and other diseases run in
families—those who are related to you
through genes passed down from biological
(birth) parent to child. This information is
called a family health history. Ask blood
relatives about their health issues like heart
disease, cancer, and diabetes, and at what
age they were diagnosed. For relatives who
were diagnosed with cancer, ask them (or
other relatives if they are no longer living)
what type of cancer they had, if they died
from the cancer, and at what age the cancer
was diagnosed.

Everyone has BRCA genes. Normal BRCA
genes help to prevent tumor growth. They help
fix damaged cells and help cells grow normally.
BRCA mutations put you at risk for more than
one type of cancer. Mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 increase the risk of breast, ovarian,
prostate, colorectal, pancreatic, and melanoma
skin cancers. Mutated BRCA genes can also
aႇect how some treatments work. These tests
might be repeated. Other genes such as PALB2, p53, CHEK2,
and ATM might be tested. For example, PALB2
normally helps prevent cancer. When PALB2
mutates, it no longer works correctly. Those
with a PALB2 mutation have a higher risk of
developing breast cancer.

## Breast cancer stage
A cancer stage is a way to describe the
extent of the cancer at the time you are first
diagnosed. Based on testing, your cancer will
be assigned a stage. Staging helps to predict
prognosis and is needed to make treatment
decisions. A prognosis is the course your
cancer will likely take.
Staging is based on a combination of
information to reach a final numbered stage.
It takes into account what can be felt during a
physical exam, what can be seen on imaging
tests, and what is found during a biopsy or
surgery. Often, not all information is available
at the initial evaluation. More information can
be gathered as treatment begins.


 Clinical stage (c) is the rating given
before any treatment. It is based on a
physical exam, biopsy, and imaging tests.
An example might look like cT0 or cN1.
Tests are done before any treatment as
part of an initial diagnosis.  Pathologic stage (p) or surgical
stage is determined by examining tissue
removed during surgery. An example
might be pT1.

The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system is
used to stage breast cancer. In this system,
the letters T, N, and M describe diႇerent areas
of cancer growth. Based on cancer test results,
your doctor will assign a score or number to
each letter. The higher the number, the larger
the tumor or the more the cancer has spread.
These scores will be combined to assign the
cancer a stage. A TNM example might look like
this: T1N0M0 or T1, N0, M0. For DCIS, it will
look like this: TisN0M0.

 T (tumor) – Depth and spread of the
main (primary) tumor(s) in one or both
breasts
 N (node) – If cancer has spread to
nearby (regional) lymph nodes
 M (metastasis) – If cancer has
spread to distant parts of the body or
metastasized

Lymphatic Àuid, a clear Àuid containing cells
that help fight infections and other diseases,
drains through channels into lymphatic
vessels. From here, lymph drains into lymph
nodes. Lymph nodes work as filters to help
fight infection. Regional lymph nodes are
found near the breast in the armpit (axilla). If
breast cancer spreads, it often goes first to
nearby lymph nodes under the arm. It can also
sometimes spread to lymph nodes near the
collarbone or near the breastbone. However,
it is possible for cancerous cells to travel
through lymph and blood to other parts of the
body without having gone to the lymph nodes
first. DCIS does not typically spread to
lymph nodes.

Grade describes how abnormal the tumor cells
look under a microscope (called histology).
Higher-grade cancers tend to grow and spread
faster than lower-grade cancers. GX means
the grade can’t be determined, followed by G1,
G2, and G3. G3 is the highest grade for breast
cancers. A low-grade tumor has a low risk of
recurrence. A high-grade tumor has a higher
risk of recurrence (of cancer returning).

Numbered stages are based on TNM scores
and receptor (hormone and HER2) status.
Stages range from stage 0 to stage 4, with
4 being the most advanced. They might be
written as stage 0, stage I, stage II, stage III,
and stage IV. InÀammatory breast cancer is
stage 3 (invasive) or 4 (metastatic).

 Stage 0 is noninvasive – Noninvasive
breast cancer is rated stage 0. Ductal
carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is found only in
the ducts (Tis). It has not spread to the
surrounding breast tissue, lymph nodes
(N0), or distant sites (M0).

 Stages 1, 2, and 3 are invasive
but not metastatic – Invasive breast
cancer is rated stage 1, 2, or 3. It has
grown outside the ducts, lobules, or
breast skin. Cancer might be in the
axillary lymph nodes.

 Stage 4 is metastatic – In stage
4 breast cancer, cancer has spread to
distant sites. It can develop from earlier
stages. Sometimes, the first diagnosis is
stage 4 metastatic breast cancer (called
de novo).
