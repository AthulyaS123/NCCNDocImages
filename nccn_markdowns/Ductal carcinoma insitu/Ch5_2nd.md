# 5. The breast after surgery

---

## Volume displacement

With a lumpectomy, most people have a
scar with some volume loss. However, if you
need a large lumpectomy and your surgeon
thinks your breast will look more abnormal
afterwards, your breast may be able to be re-
shaped at the time of surgery. This procedure
is called volume displacement or oncoplasty.
Only a limited number of cancer centers
perform this procedure. It is often done by the
cancer surgeon or plastic surgeon right after
the lumpectomy. The surgeon will shift the remaining breast tissue to fill the space left by
the removed tumor.

If volume displacement is planned, a larger
piece of your breast will need to be removed.
Despite a larger piece being removed, the
natural look of your breast will be kept.
However, with large amounts of tissue
removed, your breast may be smaller than
before.

You may not like the results of the volume
displacement. In this case, breast revision
surgery may help. This surgery is done
by a plastic surgeon. A second volume
displacement may be an option, too. Another
option is to get breast implants or mastectomy
with reconstruction.

## Flat closure

In a total mastectomy with a flat closure, the
entire breast, including nipple, extra skin,
fat, and other tissue in the breast area, is
removed. The remaining skin is tightened
and sewn together. No breast mound is
created, and no implant is added. The scar
will be slightly raised and differ in color than
the surrounding skin. A flat closure is not
completely flat or smooth. The result varies
from person to person. Ask to look at pictures
from flat closures so you know what to expect.

## Breast reconstruction

Breast reconstruction is surgery to rebuild
the shape and look of the breast after
a mastectomy. In many cases, breast
reconstruction involves a staged approach. It
might require more than one procedure.

You may have a choice as to when
breast reconstruction is done. Immediate
reconstruction is finished within hours after
removing the breast. Delayed reconstruction
can occur months or years after the cancer
surgery. Reconstruction can also be done in
stages, with part of the reconstruction done
at the time of the original cancer surgery and
finished with another surgery later. A plastic
surgeon performs breast reconstruction.

Breasts can be reconstructed with implants
and Àaps. All methods are generally safe,
but as with any surgery, there are risks. Ask
your treatment team for a complete list of side
effects.

## Breast implants
Breast implants are small bags filled with salt
water, silicone gel, or both. They are placed
under the breast skin or muscle to look like a
new breast following a mastectomy. A balloon-
like device, called an expander, may be used
first to stretch out tissue. It will be placed under
your skin or muscle and enlarged every few
weeks for 2 to 3 months. When your skin is
stretched to the proper size, you will have
surgery to place the final implant.

## Flaps Breasts 
Can be remade using skin from other parts of your body, known as flaps. These flaps
are taken from the abdomen, buttocks, thigh,
or from under the shoulder blade. Some flaps
are completely removed and then sewn in
place. Other flaps stay attached to your body
but are slid over and sewn into place.
There are several risks associated with flaps,
including death of fat in the flap, which can
cause lumps. A hernia may result from muscle
weakness. Problems are more likely to occur
among those who have diabetes or who
smoke.

## Implants and flaps
Some breasts are reconstructed with both
implants and flaps. This method may give the
reconstructed breast more volume to match
the other breast. For any reconstruction, you
may need surgery on your remaining breast to
match the size and shape of both breasts.

## Nipple replacement

Nipples can be rebuilt using skin from the breast or another part of the body. They can also be created with tattooing. Reconstructed nipples do not have sensation.

## What to consider
Some things to consider when deciding
to have fat closure or reconstruction after
mastectomy:
- **Your desire** – You may have a strong
feeling towards fat closure or one form
of reconstruction after being given the
options. Breast reconstruction should be
a shared decision between you and your
care team. Make your wishes known.
- **Health issues** – You may have health
issues such as diabetes or a blood
disorder that might affect or delay healing,
or make longer procedures unsafe.
- **Tobacco use** – Smoking delays wound
healing and can cause mastectomy Àap
death (necrosis), nipple-areola complex
(NAC) necrosis in a nipple-sparing
mastectomy, infection, and failure of
implant-based reconstruction. In free Àap
reconstruction, smoking increases the risk
of complications. You are encouraged to
stop smoking prior to reconstruction.
- **Breast size and shape** – There are
limits to the available sizes of breast
implants. Very large breasts or breasts
that lack tone or droop (called ptosis)
might be diffcult to match. Breast
reduction surgery might be an option.
- **Body mass index (BMI)** – Those with
an elevated BMI have an increased risk of
infections and complications with breast
reconstruction.

## Key points

- Volume displacement may be used after lumpectomy to improve breast appearance.  
- Flat closure is an option after mastectomy.  
- Reconstruction can use implants or your own tissue.  
- Nipples can be rebuilt or tattooed, but will not have sensation.
