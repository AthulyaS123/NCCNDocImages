## What is ductal carcinoma in situ?

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a noninvasive breast cancer. The cancer cells are found only inside the milk ducts of the breast. The word “in situ” means “in its original place.” DCIS is sometimes called stage 0 breast cancer.  

DCIS is a preinvasive disease. DCIS is treated
to prevent invasive breast cancer, a more
advanced form of cancer. Invasive breast
cancer is breast cancer that has spread from
the milk ducts or milk glands (lobules) into the
surrounding breast tissue or nearby lymph
nodes. Once outside the ducts or lobules,
breast cancer can spread through lymph or
blood to lymph nodes or other parts of the
body.

Anyone can develop breast cancer, including
those assigned male at birth. Although there
are some differences between those assigned
male and those assigned female at birth,
treatment is very similar for all genders.

## What are the parts of the breast?

The breast is a gland on the chest. The breast
is made of milk ducts, fat, nerves, lymph and
blood vessels, ligaments, and other connective
tissue. Behind the breast is the pectoral (chest)
muscle and ribs. Muscles and ligaments help
hold the breast in place.
Breast tissue contains glands that can make
milk. These milk glands are called lobules.
Lobules look like tiny clusters of grapes. Small
tubes called ducts connect the lobules to the
nipple.
The ring of darker breast skin is called the
areola. The raised tip within the areola is called
the nipple. The nipple-areola complex (NAC) is
a term that refers to both parts.
Lymph drains from breast tissue into lymph
vessels and travels to lymph nodes near your
armpit (axilla). Lymph is a clear Àuid that
gives cells water and food. It also helps to
fight germs. Nodes near the armpit are called
axillary lymph nodes (ALNs). Cancer cells
can travel though lymph and lymph vessels to
lymph nodes.

## What can you do to get the best care?

Advocate for yourself. You have an important
role to play in your care. In fact, you’re more
likely to get the care you want by asking
questions and making shared decisions with
your care team. Consider seeking the opinion
of a breast cancer specialist

The NCCN Guidelines for Patients will help
you understand cancer care. With better
understanding, you’ll be more prepared to
discuss your care with your team and share
your concerns. Many people feel more satisfied
when they play an active role in their care.

You may not know what to ask your care
team. That’s common. Each chapter in this
book ends with an important section called
Questions to ask. These suggested questions
will help you get more information on all
aspects of your care.
