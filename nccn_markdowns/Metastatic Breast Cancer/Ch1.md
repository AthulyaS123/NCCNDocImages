# What is metastatic breast cancer?
Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Metastatic breast cancer is also called advanced breast cancer.

Breast cancer starts in the cells of the breast. Over time, these cells form a mass called a primary tumor. Breast cancer cells can spread through lymph or blood to other parts of the body. It can spread locally to nearby lymph nodes but also to more distant sites of the body (metastasis). Since cancer cells can spread through the blood, it is still possible to develop distant metastases even when the lymph nodes near the breast are negative for cancer.

> Local metastasis is cancer that has spread to a nearby body part such as the axillary lymph nodes.
> Distant metastasis is cancer that has spread to a body part far from the primary (main) tumor.

Breast cancer can metastasize almost anywhere but most commonly spreads to the bone (including spine), lungs, liver, brain, or distant lymph nodes. Breast cancer that has metastasized to other parts of the body is still called breast cancer and is different than a cancer that starts in another site in the body.

Almost all breast cancers are carcinomas-cancers that start in the cells that line the inner or outer surfaces of the body. There are different types of breast carcinoma, most of which arise in cells that make up the lining (epithelial cells) in the terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs) of the breast. A TDLU consists of a lobule connected to the end of a small milk duct. The most common types of breast cancer are ductal carcinoma and lobular carcinoma.

# Why you should read this book
Making decisions about cancer care can be stressful. You may need to make tough decisions under pressure about complex choices.

The NCCN Guidelines for Patients are trusted by patients and providers. They clearly explain current care recommendations made by respected experts in the field. Recommendations are based on the latest research and practices at leading cancer centers.

Cancer care is not the same for everyone. By following expert recommendations for your situation, you are more likely to improve your care and have better outcomes as a result. Use this book as your guide to find the information you need to make important decisions.

# What's in this book?
This book is organized into the following chapters:

* **Chapter 2: Testing for MBC** provides an overview of tests you might receive and the role of HER2 status, hormone receptors, genetic cancer risk, and biomarker testing.
* Chapter 3: Breast cancer staging provides information on how breast cancer is staged.
* Chapter 4: Types of treatment gives a general overview of metastatic breast cancer treatment and what to expect.
* **Chapter 5: Supportive care** gives an overview of what supportive care is, possible side effects of treatment, and living with metastatic breast cancer.
* **Chapter 6: Your treatment options** discusses systemic (drug) therapy options specific to your cancer. Treatment is based on the cancer's hormone receptor (HR) and HER2 status, and any biomarkers that might be found.
* Chapter 7: Other resources provides information on patient advocacy groups and where to get help.

# What can you do to get the best care?
Advocate for yourself. You have an important role to play in your care. In fact, you're more likely to get the care you want by asking questions and making shared decisions with your care team. Consider seeking the opinion of a breast cancer specialist and team specializes in diagnosis and management of breast cancer.

The NCCN Guidelines for Patients will help you understand cancer care. With better understanding, you'll be more prepared to discuss your care with your team and share your concerns. Many people feel more satisfied when they play an active role in their care.

You may not know what to ask your care team. That's common. Each chapter in this book ends with an important section called Questions to ask. These suggested questions will help you get more information on all aspects of your care.
