# 5 Supportive care

Supportive care helps manage the symptoms of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and the side effects of treatment. This chapter discusses possible side effects.

People are living longer with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Since treatment can last many years, supportive care for side effects is important. Living with MBC also brings new meaning to survivorship.

## What is supportive care?

Supportive care helps improve your quality of life during and after cancer treatment. The goal is to prevent or manage side effects and symptoms, like pain and cancer-related fatigue. It also addresses the mental, social, and spiritual concerns faced by those with cancer.

> Supportive care is available to everyone with cancer and their families, not just those at the end of life. Palliative care is another name for supportive care.

Supportive care can also help with:

  * Making treatment decisions
  * Coordinating your care
  * Paying for care
  * Planning for advanced care and end of life

## Side effects

All cancer treatments can cause unwanted health issues called side effects. Side effects depend on many factors. These factors include the drug type and dose, length of treatment, and the person. Some side effects may just be unpleasant. Others may be harmful to one's health. Treatment can cause several side effects. Some are very serious. Tell your care team about any new or worsening symptoms.

### Blood clots

Cancer or cancer treatment can cause blood clots to form. This can block blood flow and oxygen in the body. Blood clots can break loose and travel to other parts of the body causing breathing problems, stroke, or other health issues. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) refers to blood clots in the veins.

### Bone health

Breast cancer may spread to your bones. Some breast cancer treatments may also weaken your bones. Both can put your bones at increased risk for injury and disease. Such problems include bone fractures, bone pain, and squeezing (compression) of the spinal cord. High levels of calcium in the blood, called hypercalcemia, may also occur.

Medicine may be given to help relieve bone pain and reduce the risk of other bone problems. Some medicines work by slowing or stopping bone breakdown, while others help increase bone thickness. It is recommended that you take calcium and vitamin D with these bone health medicines. Talk to your care team first.

### Diarrhea or constipation

Diarrhea is frequent and watery bowel movements. Your care team will tell you how to manage diarrhea. It is important to drink lots of fluids. Constipation is also common, especially if taking certain pain medicines. Drinking fluids, staying active, and taking medicines for constipation are often recommended.

### Distress

Depression, anxiety, and sleeping issues are common and are a normal part of cancer diagnosis. Talk to your care team and with those whom you feel most comfortable about how you are feeling. There are services, people, and medicine that can help you.

### Fatigue

Fatigue is extreme tiredness and inability to function due to lack of energy. Fatigue may be caused by cancer or it may be a side effect of treatment. Let your care team know how you are feeling and if fatigue is getting in the way of doing the things you enjoy. Eating a balanced diet, exercise, yoga, acupuncture, and massage therapy can help. You might be referred to a nutritionist or dietitian to help with fatigue.

### Hair loss

Chemotherapy may cause hair loss (alopecia) all over your body --- not just on your scalp. Some chemotherapy drugs are more likely than others to cause hair loss. Dosage might also affect the amount of hair loss. Most of the time, hair loss from chemotherapy is temporary. Hair often regrows 3 to 6 months after treatment ends. Your hair may be a different shade or texture at first. Scalp cooling (or scalp hypothermia) might help lessen hair loss in those receiving certain types of chemotherapy.

> It is important to tell your care team about all of your side effects, including new or worsening symptoms.

### Infections

Infections occur more frequently and are more severe in those with a weakened immune system. Drug treatment for breast cancer can weaken the body's natural defense against infections. If not treated early, infections can be fatal.

Neutropenia, a low number of white blood cells, can lead to frequent or severe infections. When someone with neutropenia also develops a fever, it is called febrile neutropenia (FN). With FN, your risk of infection may be higher than normal. This is because a low number of white blood cells leads to a reduced ability to fight infections. FN is a side effect of some types of systemic therapy.

### Loss of appetite

Sometimes side effects from surgery, cancer, or its treatment might cause you to feel not hungry or sick to your stomach (nauseated). You might have a sore mouth. Healthy eating is important during treatment. It includes eating a balanced diet, eating the right amount of food, and drinking enough fluids. A registered dietitian who is an expert in nutrition and food can help. Speak to your care team if you have trouble eating or maintaining weight.

### Low blood cell counts

Some cancer treatments can cause low blood cell counts.

  * **Anemia** is a condition where your body does not have enough healthy red blood cells, resulting in less oxygen being carried to your body tissues. You might tire easily or feel short of breath if you are anemic.
  * **Neutropenia** is a decrease in neutrophils, the most common type of white blood cell. This puts you at risk for infection.
  * **Thrombocytopenia** is a condition where there are not enough platelets found in the blood. This puts you at risk for bleeding.

### Lymphedema

Lymphedema is a condition in which lymph fluid builds up in tissues and causes swelling. It may be caused when part of the lymph system is damaged or blocked, such as during surgery to remove lymph nodes, or by radiation therapy. Cancers that block lymph vessels can also cause lymphedema. Swelling usually develops slowly over time. It may develop during treatment, or it may start years after treatment. If you have lymphedema, you may be referred to an expert in lymphedema management. The swelling may be reduced by exercise, massage, compression devices, and other means.

### Nausea and vomiting

Nausea and vomiting are common side effects of treatment. You will be given medicine to prevent nausea and vomiting. Your care team can also provide information on non-medical ways to help with nausea and vomiting.

### Neurocognitive or neuropsychological effects

Some treatments can damage the nervous system (neurotoxicity) causing problems with concentration and memory. Survivors are at risk for neurotoxicity and might be recommended for neuropsychological testing. Neuropsychology looks at how the health of your brain affects your thinking and behavior. Neuropsychological testing can identify your limits and doctors can create a plan to help with these limits.

### Neuropathy and neurotoxicity

Some treatments can damage the nervous system (neurotoxicity) causing neuropathy and problems with concentration, memory, and thinking. Neuropathy is a nerve problem that causes pain, numbness, tingling, swelling, or muscle weakness in different parts of the body. It usually begins in the hands or feet and gets worse with additional cycles of treatment. Most of the time, neuropathy improves gradually and may eventually go away after treatment.

### Organ issues

Treatment might cause your kidneys, liver, heart, and pancreas to not work as well as they should.

### Pain

Tell your care team about any pain or discomfort. You might meet with a palliative care specialist or with a pain specialist to manage pain.

### Palliative care

Palliative care is appropriate for anyone, regardless of age, cancer stage, or the need for other therapies. It focuses on physical, emotional, social, and spiritual needs that affect quality of life.

### Quality of life

Cancer and its treatment can affect your overall well-being or quality of life (QOL). For more information on quality of life, see *NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Palliative Care* at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app

### Late effects

Late effects are side effects that occur months or years after treatment is completed. Late effects may be caused by cancer or cancer treatment. They may include physical, mental, and social health concerns, and second cancers. The sooner late effects are treated the better. Ask the care team about what late effects could occur. This will help you know what to look for.

## Survivorship

A person is a cancer survivor from the time of diagnosis until the end of life. Your health will be monitored for side effects of treatment. It is important to keep any follow-up care and imaging test appointments. Seek good routine medical care, including regular doctor visits for preventive care and cancer screening.

A personalized survivorship care plan will contain a summary of possible long-term effects of treatment called late effects and a list of follow-up tests. Find out how your primary care provider will coordinate with specialists for your follow-up care.

Keep these things in mind:

  * Tell your care team about any symptoms such as headaches, menstrual spotting between periods or new onset of spotting after menopause (if prior tamoxifen), shortness of breath when walking, or bone pain. Side effects can be managed.
  * Continue to take all medicine such as endocrine therapy exactly as prescribed and do not miss or skip doses. If you are experiencing side effects, talk to your care team.

### Monitoring metastatic disease

You will be monitored during treatment for metastatic breast cancer. Monitoring includes physical exams, blood tests, imaging scans, and tumor testing (if needed). Monitoring is used to see if your cancer is responding to treatment, is stable, or is progressing. It is important to keep follow-up visits and test appointments. Contact your doctor if you have any new or worsening symptoms.

Monitoring is important. You will be monitored for symptoms caused by cancer, such as pain from bone metastases. The goal of monitoring is to determine if treatment provides benefit. Benefit includes keeping cancer stable.

### Lifestyle changes

Changes in your lifestyle can help manage side effects and improve treatment results. Lifestyle changes include eating a balanced and nutritious diet, exercising regularly, limiting alcohol, and quitting smoking. Your care team can offer information and support on lifestyle changes.

### Living with metastatic breast cancer

Those living with MBC often have unique challenges not experienced by other breast cancer survivors. Living with MBC can be stressful—financially, emotionally, physically, and spiritually. Take care of yourself. Seek out support groups at your local hospital, through social media, or from those listed in the back of this book. Look to friends, relatives, neighbors, and coworkers for social support. Your cancer care team or one of your primary health care providers can be a great source of information and support if you are experiencing any changes in your mental, physical, emotional, sexual, or financial health.
