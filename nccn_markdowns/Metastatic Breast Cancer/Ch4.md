This chapter provides a general overview of the types of systemic therapy used to treat metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Systemic therapy is drug therapy that works throughout the body.

# Care team

Treating breast cancer takes a team approach. Treatment decisions should involve a multidisciplinary team (MDT). An MDT is a team of health care and psychosocial care professionals from different professional backgrounds who have knowledge (expertise) and experience in your type of cancer. This team is united in the planning and implementing of your treatment. Ask who will coordinate your care.

Some members of your care team will be with you throughout cancer treatment, while others will only be there for parts of it. Get to know your care team and help them get to know you.

# Systemic therapy

Systemic therapy is the main or primary treatment for metastatic breast cancer. The goal of treatment is to prevent or slow the spread of cancer.

System therapy is drug therapy that works throughout the body. It includes:

  * Chemotherapy
  * Antibody drug conjugates
  * HER2-targeted therapy
  * Other targeted therapies
  * Immunotherapy
  * Endocrine therapy

Treatment for metastatic breast cancer is a combination of systemic therapies that are often given in a specific order (sequential). The choice of therapy takes into consideration many factors, including HER2 and hormone receptor tumor status, your preferences about treatment, and if you have any other serious health conditions. Goals of systemic therapy should be discussed before starting treatment.

# Treatment options

Treatment options are often described in the following ways:

  * **Preferred therapies** have the most evidence they work better and may be safer than other therapies.
  * **Other recommended therapies** may not work quite as well as preferred therapies, but they can still help treat cancer.
  * **Therapies used in certain cases** work best for people with specific cancer features or health circumstances.

For a general list of systemic therapies, see **Guide 2**.

**Endocrine therapy**

  * Endocrine therapy can be found in Guide 3.

> Systemic therapy is based on the cancer's hormone receptor (HR) and HER2 status, and any biomarkers that might be found.

# Endocrine therapy

Endocrine therapy blocks estrogen or progesterone to treat hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer. The endocrine system is made up of organs and tissues that produce hormones. Hormones are natural chemicals released into the bloodstream.

There are 4 hormones that might be targeted in endocrine therapy:

  * **Estrogen** is made mainly by the ovaries, but is also made by other tissues in the body such as fat tissue.
  * **Progesterone** is made mainly by the ovaries.
  * **Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH)** is made by a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. It tells the ovaries to make estrogen and progesterone and testicles to make testosterone. LHRH is also called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).
  * **Androgen** is made by the adrenal glands, testicles, and ovaries.

Hormones may cause breast cancer to grow. Endocrine therapy will stop your body from making hormones or it will block what hormones do in the body. This can slow tumor growth or shrink the tumor for a period of time.

Endocrine therapy is sometimes called hormone therapy or anti-estrogen. It is not the same as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) used for menopause.

Cancer treatment can cause temporary menopause. If you stopped having periods due to removal of your uterus (hysterectomy) but you still have your ovaries, then you may have your menopausal status confirmed with a blood test. If both ovaries have been removed (with or without your uterus), you are in menopause.

Those who want to have children in the future should discuss fertility plans with their doctor and may need to be referred to a fertility specialist before starting endocrine therapy.

Types of endocrine therapy can be found in **Guide 3**.

# Testosterone

For those assigned male at birth whose bodies continue to make testosterone, endocrine therapy includes tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor (AI) with a testosterone-suppressing therapy.

# Premenopause

If you have menstrual periods, you are in premenopause. In premenopause, the ovaries are the main source of estrogen and progesterone.

GnRH agonists may be used to temporarily induce menopause for those in premenopause. A combination of GnRH agonists and tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors (AIs) may be considered as endocrine therapy for those in premenopause.

# Menopause

In menopause, the ovaries permanently stop producing hormones and menstrual periods stop. Estrogen and progesterone levels are low, but the adrenal glands, liver, and body fat continue to make small amounts of estrogen. If you don't have periods, a test using a blood sample may be used to confirm your status.

### Guide 3 Endocrine therapy types

| Category | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Bilateral oophorectomy** | Surgery to remove both ovaries. |
| **Ovarian ablation** | Radiation to permanently stop the ovaries from making hormones. |
| **Ovarian or testosterone suppression** | Drugs to temporarily stop the ovaries or testicles from making hormones such as LHRH and GnRH.<br>• LHRH agonists include goserelin (Zoladex) and leuprolide (Lupron Depot). These are injected every 4 or 12 weeks. They do not affect estrogen made by the ovaries.<br>• GnRH agonists might be used to suppress ovarian hormone or testosterone production. |
| **Aromatase inhibitors (AIs)** | Drugs to stop a type of hormone called androgen from changing into estrogen by interfering with an enzyme called aromatase. They do not affect estrogen made by the ovaries. Nonsteroidal AIs include anastrozole (Arimidex) and letrozole (Femara). Exemestane (Aromasin) is a steroidal AI. |
| **Estrogen receptor (ER) modulators or anti-estrogens** | • Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) block estrogen from attaching to hormone receptors. Tamoxifen and toremifene (Fareston) are SERMs.<br>• Selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs) block and destroy estrogen receptors. Fulvestrant (Faslodex) and elacestrant (Orserdu) are SERDs. |
| **Hormones** | Hormone examples include ethinyl estradiol, fluoxymesterone, and megestrol acetate (Megace). |

# Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy kills fast-dividing cells throughout the body, including cancer cells and some normal cells. More than one chemotherapy may be used to treat breast cancer. When only one drug is used, it's called a single agent. A combination or multi-agent regimen is the use of two or more chemotherapy drugs.

Some chemotherapy drugs are liquids that are infused into a vein (IV) or injected under the skin with a needle. Other chemotherapy drugs may be given as a pill that is swallowed.

Some examples of chemotherapy drugs include the following:

  * **Anthracyclines** include doxorubicin (Adriamycin), doxorubicin liposomal injection (Doxil), and epirubicin (Ellence)
  * **Taxanes** include docetaxel, paclitaxel, and albumin-bound paclitaxel.
  * **Antimetabolites** include capecitabine (Xeloda), fluorouracil, gemcitabine, and methotrexate.

Most chemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment days followed by days of rest. This allows the body to recover before the next cycle. Cycles vary in length depending on which drugs are used. The number of treatment days per cycle and the total number of cycles given also vary.

> Standard of care is the best-known way to treat a particular disease based on past clinical trials. There may be more than one treatment regimen that is considered standard of care. Ask your care team what treatment options are available and if a clinical trial might be right for you.

# Antibody drug conjugates

An antibody drug conjugate (ADC) delivers cell-specific chemotherapy. It attaches to a protein found on the outside of the cancer cell, then enters the cell. Once inside the cell, chemotherapy is released. ADCs are given in cycles. ADC examples include ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla), fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (Enhertu, T-DXd), sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (Trodelvy), and datopotamab deruxtecan-dink (Datroway).

# HER2-targeted therapy

HER2 is a protein involved in normal cell growth. There might be higher amounts of HER2 in your breast cancer. If this is the case, it is called HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer. HER2-targeted therapy is drug therapy that treats HER2+ breast cancer. Some HER2-targeted therapy is given with chemotherapy. However, it might be used alone or in combination with endocrine therapy.

HER2-targeted therapies include:

  * **HER2 antibodies** prevent HER2 growth signals from outside the cell. They also increase the attack of immune cells on cancer cells.
  * **HER2 inhibitors** stop HER2 growth signals from within the cell.
  * **HER2 conjugates or HER2 antibody drug conjugates (ADCs)** deliver cell-specific chemotherapy. They attach directly to HER2 flags on the outside of the cell to enter the cell. Once inside, chemotherapy is released.

> Your heart will be monitored before and during treatment with HER2-targeted therapy. Tests will measure the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), the amount of blood pumping from the left side of the heart.

# Other targeted therapies

This section is for inhibitors that are different from inhibitors used in HER2-targeted therapy.

# CDK4/6 inhibitors

Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) is a cell protein that helps cells grow and divide. For hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative (HER2-) cancer, taking a CDK4/6 inhibitor with endocrine therapy may help control cancer longer and improve survival. CDK4/6 inhibitors include abemaciclib (Verzenio), palbociclib (Ibrance), and ribociclib (Kisqali). Those in premenopause must also receive ovarian ablation or suppression with CDK4/6 inhibitors.

# PARP inhibitors

Cancer cells often become damaged. PARP is a cell protein that repairs cancer cells and allows them to survive. Blocking PARP can cause cancer cells to die. Olaparib (Lynparza) and talazoparib (Talzenna) are examples of a PARP inhibitor (PARPi).

**PIK3CA, PTEN, and AKT1 inhibitors**
The PIK3CA gene is one of the most frequently mutated genes in breast cancers. PTEN and AKT are also part of this important pathway in cancer cells and can be altered less commonly in breast cancers. A mutation or alteration in these genes can lead to increased growth of cancer cells and resistance to various treatments. Alpelisib (Piqray) and inavolisib (Itovebi) are examples of PIK3CA inhibitors and capivasertib (Truqap) is an AKT1 inhibitor.

**mTOR inhibitors**
mTOR is a cell protein that helps cells grow and divide. Endocrine therapy may stop working if mTOR becomes overactive. mTOR inhibitors are used to get endocrine therapy working again.

Everolimus (Afinitor) is an mTOR inhibitor. It can be taken with exemestane, fulvestrant, or tamoxifen.

# Immunotherapy

Immunotherapy is a type of systemic treatment that tries to reactivate the immune system against tumor cells. The immune system has many on and off switches. Tumors take advantage of off switches. Immunotherapy can block off switches, which helps the immune system turn on. Immunotherapy can be given alone or with other types of treatment. Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and dostarlimab-gxly (Jemperli) are examples of immunotherapy.

# Warnings about supplements and drug interactions

You might be asked to stop taking or avoid certain herbal supplements when on a systemic therapy. Some supplements can affect the ability of a drug to do its job. This is called a drug interaction.

It is critical to speak with your care team about any supplements you may be taking. Some examples include:

  * Turmeric
  * Ginkgo biloba
  * Green tea extract
  * St. John's Wort
  * Antioxidants

Certain medicines can also affect the ability of a drug to do its job. Antacids, heart or blood pressure medicine, and antidepressants are just some of the medicines that might interact with a systemic therapy or supportive care medicines given during systemic therapy. Therefore, it is very important to tell your care team about any medicines, vitamins, over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, herbals, or supplements you are taking.

Bring a list with you to every visit.

# Bone-strengthening therapy

Medicines that target the bones may be given to help relieve bone pain or reduce the risk of bone-related problems. Some medicines work by slowing or stopping bone breakdown, while others help increase bone thickness.

When breast cancer spreads to distant sites, it may metastasize in your bones. This puts your bones at risk for injury and disease. Such problems include fractures, bone pain, high calcium levels in the blood, and squeezing (compression) of the spinal cord. Some treatments for breast cancer, like aromatase inhibitors or GnRH agonists, can cause bone loss (osteoporosis), which puts you at an increased risk for fractures.

Drugs used to prevent bone loss and fractures:

  * Oral bisphosphonates
  * Zoledronic acid (Zometa)
  * Pamidronate (Aredia)
  * Denosumab (Prolia)

Drugs used to treat bone metastases:

  * Zoledronic acid (Zometa)
  * Pamidronate (Aredia)
  * Denosumab (Xgeva)

> You may be screened for bone weakness (osteoporosis) using a bone mineral density test. This measures how much calcium and other minerals are in your bones. It is also called a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan and is painless. Bone mineral density tests look for osteoporosis and help predict your risk for bone fractures.

# Zoledronic acid, pamidronate, and denosumab

Zoledronic acid, pamidronate, and denosumab are used to prevent bone loss (osteoporosis) and fractures caused by endocrine therapy. Zoledronic acid and denosumab are also used in those with metastatic breast cancer who have bone metastases to help reduce the likelihood of fractures, pain, or other complications arising from cancer in bone.

You might have blood tests to monitor kidney function, calcium levels, and magnesium levels. A calcium and vitamin D supplement will likely be recommended by your doctor.

Let your dentist know if you are taking any of these medicines. Also, ask your care team how these medicines might affect your teeth and jaw. Osteonecrosis, or bone tissue death of the jaw, is a rare but serious side effect. Tell your care team about any planned trips to the dentist and surgeries or dental procedures that might also affect the jawbone. It will be important to take care of your teeth and to see a dentist before starting treatment with any of these drugs.

# Clinical trials

A clinical trial is a type of medical research study. After being developed and tested in a lab, potential new ways of treating cancer need to be studied in people. If found to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a drug, device, or treatment approach may be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider all of the treatment options available for their cancer type, including standard treatments and clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether a clinical trial may make sense for you.

# Phases

Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment and are done in phases.

  * **Phase 1** trials study the safety and side effects of an investigational drug or treatment approach.
  * **Phase 2** trials study how well the drug or approach works against a specific type of cancer.
  * **Phase 3** trials test the drug or approach against a standard treatment. If the results are good, it may be approved by the FDA.
  * **Phase 4** trials study the safety and benefit of an FDA-approved treatment.

## Who can enroll?

It depends on the clinical trial's rules, called eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age, cancer type and stage, treatment history, or general health. They ensure that participants are alike in specific ways and that the trial is as safe as possible for the participants.

# Informed consent

Clinical trials are managed by a research team. This group of experts will review the study with you in detail, including its purpose and the risks and benefits of joining. All of this information is also provided in an informed consent form. Read the form carefully and ask questions before signing it. Take time to discuss it with people you trust. Keep in mind that you can leave and seek treatment outside of the clinical trial at any time.

## Will I get a placebo?

Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines) are almost never used alone in cancer clinical trials. It is common to receive either a placebo with a standard treatment, or a new drug with a standard treatment. You will be informed, verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a clinical trial before you enroll.

## Are clinical trials free?

There is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The study sponsor pays for research-related costs, including the study drug. But you may need to pay for other services, like transportation or childcare, due to extra appointments. During the trial, you will continue to receive standard cancer care. This care is often covered by insurance.
