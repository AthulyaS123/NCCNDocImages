Systemic therapy is the main or primary treatment for metastatic breast cancer (MBC). The goal of treatment is to prevent or slow the spread of cancer. Systemic therapy is based on the cancer's hormone receptor (HR) and HER2 status, and any biomarkers that might be found. Together, you and your care team will choose a treatment plan that is best for you.

This chapter provides specific treatment options based on hormone receptor (HR) and HER2 tumor status.

# HR+ with HER2-

In hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer, estrogen (ER+), progesterone receptors (PR+), or both (ER+/PR+) are found. When no HER2 receptors are found, then it is HER2-negative (HER2-). Initial treatment for HR+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer is most often endocrine therapy plus a CDK4/6 inhibitor (abemaciclib, ribociclib, or palbociclib). The next treatment will depend on your tumor's response to the initial treatment, the types of mutations that are specific to your cancer, and if your situation or health has changed.

Treatment is based on:

  * How aggressive the cancer is and if it is negatively affecting your organs (visceral crisis)
  * If you had endocrine therapy and if yes, then how long ago and what type

## Visceral crisis

When cancer within internal organs (metastasis) causes severe symptoms or causes organs to stop working as they should, it is called a visceral crisis. If you are in visceral crisis, the goal is to decrease the cancer quickly. This may be accomplished by using chemotherapy or other systemic therapies.

## No visceral crisis

If you are not in visceral crisis, then endocrine therapy often combined with CDK4/6 inhibitors is usually given. CDK4/6 inhibitors include abemaciclib, palbociclib, and ribociclib. Later, systemic therapy specific to HER2- breast cancer will be given. Those who are premenopausal might have ovarian suppression or ablation in addition to endocrine therapy. Systemic therapy options (including endocrine therapy) can be found in **Guide 4**.

Sometimes, HR+ cancer does not respond or stops responding to endocrine therapy. If this happens, chemotherapy or antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) will be given. If an ER+ tumor is resistant to endocrine therapy (endocrine refractory), then triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) systemic therapy options found on page 49 will be considered.

# HER2+

When HER2 receptors are found (amplified or overexpressed), the cancer is HER2-positive (HER2+). It is treated with HER2-targeted therapy and other systemic therapies as found in **Guide 5**.

Those with HER2+ and HR+ disease may also benefit from treatment with endocrine therapy. These can include aromatase inhibitors (Als), tamoxifen, fulvestrant, or CDK 4/6 inhibitors. Those who are premenopausal might have ovarian suppression or ablation in addition to endocrine therapy.

# Triple-negative breast cancer

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is estrogen receptor-negative (ER-), progesterone receptor-negative (PR-), and HER2-negative (HER2-).

There are many variations within TNBC. It is a group of diseases that we are learning more about all the time. Treatment is usually chemotherapy, and sometimes immunotherapy or targeted therapy.

TNBC systemic therapy options are found in **Guide 6**.

# Monitoring

You will be monitored throughout treatment. Monitoring includes physical exams, blood tests, imaging scans, and tumor testing (if needed). Monitoring is used to see if your cancer is responding to treatment, is stable, or is progressing.

Monitoring is important. You will be monitored for symptoms caused by cancer, such as pain from bone metastases. The goal of monitoring is to determine if treatment provides benefit. Benefit includes keeping cancer stable.

It is important to keep follow-up visits and imaging test appointments. Seek good routine medical care. Continue to take all medicines as prescribed.

## Disease progression

Disease progression is defined by the growth or spread of cancer as shown on imaging tests or physical exam of the tumor.

Most people will be able to have many rounds (lines) of systemic therapy. After multiple lines of systemic therapy, it might be time to consider ending systemic therapy and focus on supportive care. Supportive care is sometimes called palliative care. Systemic therapy has side effects that may impact your quality of life. If you and your care team decide to stop systemic therapy, supportive care will continue.

Your preferences and goals of treatment are always important. The goals of treatment can be thought of as curative or palliative. This means that treatment aims to cure or in the case of palliative care, treatment aims to preserve function and/or maintain comfort. Goals of treatment may change over time. Talk with your care team and make your wishes known.

## Progression or toxicity on endocrine therapy

First-line therapy is the first treatment given. If HR+ cancer progresses while on first-line endocrine therapy, then you will likely switch to a different endocrine therapy. Targeted therapy might be added. Sometimes, your cancer becomes resistant to endocrine therapy. If this happens, endocrine therapy will be stopped and another systemic therapy such as chemotherapy or an antibody drug conjugate will be used.

**Cancer progresses on systemic therapy with HER2-targeted therapy**
If HER2+ cancer progresses while on HER2-targeted therapy, then different HER2-targeted therapy will be given.

# Key points

  * In hormone receptor-positive (HR+) cancer, estrogen receptors (ER+), progesterone receptors (PR+), or both (ER+/PR+) are found.
  * In HER2-positive (HER2+) cancer, HER2 is either overexpressed or amplified. HER2+ cancer is treated with HER2-targeted therapy and other systemic therapies.
  * Initial treatment for HR+ with HER2- is most often endocrine therapy plus a CDK4/6 inhibitor.
  * Those with HR+ and HER2+ disease may also benefit from treatment with both endocrine therapy and HER2-targeted therapies.
  * In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), receptors for estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 are not found. TNBC is usually treated with chemotherapy and sometimes immunotherapy or targeted therapy.
  * Before each new line of therapy, you and your care team will discuss the risks and benefits of treatment, your overall health, and your goals for treatment.
  * It is important to keep follow-up visits and imaging test appointments. Seek good routine medical care, including preventive care and cancer screenings. Continue to take all medicines as prescribed.

# Questions to ask

  * What treatments do you recommend and why?
  * Does the order of treatments matter?
  * Which option is proven to work best for my type of cancer, age, overall health, and other factors?
  * Are there resources to help me pay for treatment or other care I may need?
  * How long will I be on this systemic (drug) therapy or endocrine therapy?
